A 1/1 bid shows 6+ dummy points and either a 5+ card suit or no lower 4-card suit.
Bid 4-card suits up the line
but with two 5+-card suits bid the highest first.

#### 1♦
A diamond suit is automatically skipped in favor of a major unless the hand is strong enough to force to game.
1♦ may also show a balanced 6-8 points and a desire for opener to declare 1NT.

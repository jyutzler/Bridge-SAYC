A 1/1 bid generally shows 6+ dummy points and either a 5+ card suit or no lower 4-card suit.

#### 1♦
A diamond suit is automatically skipped in favor of a major unless the hand is strong enough to force to game.
1♦ may also show a balanced 6-8 points and a desire for opener to declare 1NT. 


#### 1NT
1NT shows a balanced 8–10 points and denies a four-card major.
It is not forcing, but opener is expected to bid with a strong and/or unbalanced hand.

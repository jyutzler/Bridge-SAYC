Opener’s rebids are natural and standard.

#### Rebids with a minimum hand (13–16 points with distribution)
   * Raising responder’s suit at the lowest level (usually four cards, though good three-card support is acceptable if notrump is not);
   * 1NT with a balanced hand and no support for responder's suit;
   * Rebidding a new suit at the one level or rebidding a new suit at the two level that
is lower ranking than the opening suit (not reversing);
   * Rebidding opener’s suit at the lowest level.

#### Rebids with a medium hand (17–18 points with distribution)
   * Jump raise or jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Reverse in a new suit, i.e., bid a new suit at the two level which is higher ranking
than the opening suit;
   * Non-reverse bid in a new suit (this has the wide range of 13–18 points)

#### With a maximum hand (19–21 or 22 points) opener must make a very strong rebid:
   * Jump in notrump;
   * Double jump raise of responder’s suit or double jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Jump shift or reverse in a new suit.

Responder follows up by attempting to sign off in game, bidding 4NT
Blackwood, or cuebidding if still interested in trying to cooperate with opener
in making the slam decision.

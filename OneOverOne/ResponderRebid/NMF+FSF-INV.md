If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

#### Sign-off
Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

1♥ — 1♠

2♣

   * Pass
   * 2♥ = 2-3 hearts, likely misfit
   * 2♠ = 6+ spades

This also applies to minor suit openings with one additional treatment.

1♣ — 1♠

1NT

   * Pass, 2♣
   * 2♠ = 6+ spades
   * 2♥ = sign-off - opener must pass or correct (5-5 or 5-4 distribution)
   
#### Inviting Game
Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, 3 of opener's suit:

1♥ — 1♠

2♦ — 2NT, 3♦, 3♥ = 11–12 points, inviting game.

In addition, a new minor suit at the responder's second bid or later is forcing for one round and thus
is invitational at the 2-level and game forcing at the 3-level.

1♥ — 1♠

1NT (or 2♣) — 2♦ (forcing)

In this case, opener is encouraged to show secondary support for responder's suit. 
When more than one minor is available, it tends to show a stopper for NT.

#### Forcing to Game
All second round jumps (except for opener's suit as mentioned above) 
and new suits above two of the first bid suit are forcing to 3NT or higher: 

1♥ — 1♠

1NT or 2m

   * 3♥ = game forcing (5-5 or 5-4 distribution)
   * 3♠ = game forcing (6+ cards)

Opener can sign off in game or make a slam try. 
4NT is Blackwood (see topic) only if suit agreement has been established. 
Otherwise it is quantitative, asking responder to proceed with a maximum. 
Suit bids usually show controls.

#### Signing off at Game
Any bid of game is a sign-off, though partner can proceed with a maximum (see Slam Bidding).

### Landy vs 1NT
Landy is a simple defense to 1NT. 
If another system is present, 
then use that system vs. strong NT (any system including 15HCP or higher in its range) 
and use this one only against weak NT.

It only has one artificial bid:
 * Double: Penalty
 * 2♣: Majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
 * 2NT: Minors
 * Others: Natural

After 2♣, advancer generally bids the better major.

 * pass: No major, long clubs
 * 2♦: No preference
 * 2♥, 2♠: Weak, sign-off
 * 2NT: Forcing, invitational in either major
 * 3♥, 3♠: Limit raise
 * 4♥, 4♠: To play

#### Passed Hand
Since it is impossible to have a penalty double as a passed hand,
double is a relay to 2♣.

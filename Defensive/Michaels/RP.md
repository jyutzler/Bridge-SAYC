### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

If the opening is in a minor suit, the cuebid shows the majors; 
if the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

(1♦) — 2♦ = at least 5–5 in the majors.

(1♠) — 2♠ = at least 5–5 in hearts and a minor.

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.

Responder can bid 2NT over a major suit cuebid to ask for partner’s minor.

(1♥) — 2♥ — (Pass) — 2NT (asks for the minor).
   * 3♣ = club suit.
   * 3♦ = diamond suit.

When vulnerable, it is best to avoid very weak hands. 
This also makes it easier for advancer to decide to bid game.
When non-vulnerable, the low-end range is much wider. 
To invite game, advancer bids 2NT (to ask for the minor) followed by 3 of a suit (slow arrival).

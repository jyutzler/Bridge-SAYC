#### Cappelletti Cue Bids
If the opponents have bid two suits, a cue bid shows a 5-4 hand as follows:

* lower suit: 5-card suit is the lower unbid suit
* higher suit: 5-card suit is the higher unbid suit

When this system is in use, a double shows a 4-4 hand 
(or rarely one with significant extras).

### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
(In rare circumstances it may show 4-5 distribution.)

(1♦) - 2NT = hearts and clubs

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.

In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Note: Unusual 2NT is off in the reopening seat (see above).

### NT Overcalls
#### Direct
A 1NT overcall shows 15–18 points and a balanced hand (preferably a stopper in
opener’s suit). No conventional responses are used to the 1NT overcall except 2♣,
which is Stayman.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 19-21 points.

#### Reopening
A reopening 1NT after an opponent has opened shows 10–14 points. 
This is a wide range, but there will not usually be a game on for you.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 15-18 points 
or jump to 2NT to show 19-21.

#### Vs. Preempts
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in notrump is natural.

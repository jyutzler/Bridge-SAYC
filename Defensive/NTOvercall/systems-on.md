### NT Overcalls

With appropriate strength and a stopper in the opponent's suit,
you may make a NT overcall.

|Hand|Direct|Reopening|2-level|3-level|
|10-14|pass or double then pass|pass or 1NT|pass|pass|
|15-18|1NT|double then 1NT|2NT|maybe 3NT|
|19-21|double then bid NT|2NT|3NT|3NT|
|22-24|double then jump NT|3NT|3NT|3NT|

All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

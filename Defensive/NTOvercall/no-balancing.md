### NT Overcalls
#### Direct
A 1NT overcall shows 15–18 points and a balanced hand (preferably a stopper in
opener’s suit). All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 19-21 points.

#### Reopening
A reopening 1NT after an opponent has opened shows the same as in the direct position.

#### Vs. Preempts
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in notrump is natural.

### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 7–16 points nonvulnerable and 9-16 points vulnerable
(double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
In general an overcall shows 5+ cards 
but it may show a strong 4 (AKJx) at the one level.

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠: a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣: a hand that would open 3♣.
   
A balancing bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.

When the opponents have bid two suits,
an overcall in either suit is natural.

#### Diamonds over 1♣
The one exception to overcalls is over 1♣ where an overcall of 1♦ does little to obstruct the opponents.
(1♣)
   * 1♦: a good 4, a light overcall with 5, weak 2 (Vul only), or a maximum overcall (will bid again if possible)
   * 2♦: sound overcall (would bid over 1♠)
   * 3♦: standard preemptive bid OR weak 2 strength (NV only)

#### vs. Opening Preempt
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural. 
At the two level it can show any opening hand with a five-card suit. 
At the three-level it should show extras - 15+ total points.
At the four-level it should show significant extras: 17+ total points.
A jump raise over a Weak-Two also shows significant extras but is non-forcing. 
(With a Strong-Two hand, double first then jump to game.)
A jump overcall to game is to play and is semi-preemptive.
In the balancing seat, an overcall can be a king lighter.

#### Responses
Raises are natural and generally preemptive.
A new suit is non-forcing but constructive.

A cuebid of opener’s suit by an unpassed hand shows any good hand and is forcing for one round. Advancer will return to Overcaller's suit to show a limit raise or better.
A cuebid of opener's suit by a passed hand shows good support (limit raise or better).

Examples:
(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦:
   * (Pass) — 2♠: minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other: natural, game-forcing.

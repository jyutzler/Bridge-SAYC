### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 8–16 points nonvulnerable and 10-16 points vulnerable
(double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
In general an overcall shows 5+ cards 
but it may show a strong 4 (AKJx) at the one level.
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural.

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

The one exception is over 1♣ where an overcall of 1♦ does little to obstruct the opponents.
(1♣)
   * 1♦ = a good 4, often lead-directing
   * 2♦ = sound overcall (would bid over 1♠)
   
When the opponents have bid two suits,
an overcall in either suit is natural.

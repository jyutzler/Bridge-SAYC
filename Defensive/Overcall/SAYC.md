## Overcalls
Overcalls show 8–16 points (double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
though it can be lighter at the minimum end.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in a suit is natural.

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid two suits is natural in either suit.

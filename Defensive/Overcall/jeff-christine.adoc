### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 7–16+ points nonvulnerable and 9-16+ points vulnerable
(double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
In general an overcall shows 5+ cards 
but it may show a strong 4 (e.g., AKJx) at the one level.

#### Jump Overcalls
Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦):

* 2♠: a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
* 3♣: a hand that would open 3♣.

#### vs. Opening Preempt
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural. 

* Two-level: any opening hand with a five-card suit
* Three-level: extras: 15+ total points
* Four-level: significant extras: 17+ total points
* Jump raise over a Weak-Two: significant extras, but non-forcing
(with a Strong-Two hand, double first then jump to game.)
* Jump overcall to game is to play and is semi-preemptive

#### Balancing
A balancing bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.

#### Advances
Raises are natural and generally preemptive.
A new suit is non-forcing but constructive.

* A cuebid of opener’s suit by an unpassed hand shows any good hand and is forcing for one round. Advancer will return to Overcaller's suit to show a limit raise or better.
For example:
(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦:

** (Pass) — 2♠: minimum overcall.
** (Pass) — other: natural, game-forcing.
* A cuebid of opener's suit by a passed hand shows good support (limit raise or better)
* A jump cuebid shows a mixed raise (4 cards, constructive but less than a limit raise)

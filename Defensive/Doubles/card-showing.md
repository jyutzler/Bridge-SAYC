### Card-Showing Doubles
Card-showing doubles are used when there is a general desire to act but no clear direction.
Partner is asked to "do something intelligent" like bid an unbid four-card suit,
rebid a good suit, bid NT, or show secondary support.
Generally they are for takeout but they may be converted to penalty (like a Negative Double).


This branch contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes the system that Steve Reed and Jeff Yutzler will use for the LM/NLM game. 
Major openings are loosely based on Washington Standard - 2 over 1 game force (no exceptions) with a reasonable set of conventions.
1 Club openings are transfers and other artificial bids. 
1 Diamond openings are fairly standard, but 1♦-2♣ is not a game force if clubs are rebid.
Note that we generally don't promise specific point counts or minimum shapes. 

## General Approach 
Two-over-one game forcing with five-card majors

Strong forcing opening: 2♣;
## Notrump Opening Bids 
Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is especially strong. 
The following semi-balanced hands may be treated as balanced:
   * 5-4-2-2 (unless the length is in both majors)
   * 6-3-2-2 (unless the length is in a major)
   * 5-4-3-1 or 4-4-4-1 (if the length is not in both majors, the singleton is Q or better, and rebid problems are likely)

The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:

   * 12-14: Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT
   * 15-17: Open 1NT
   * 18-19: Open 1♣, rebid 1NT or an artificial bid
   * 20-21: Open 2NT
   * 22-24: Open 2♣, rebid NT
   * 25-27: Open 3NT
   * 28+: Open 2♣, jump NT

When non-vulnerable, these point ranges drop by a point.
These point ranges are not exact; 
hands are upgraded or downgraded due to texture.

### 1NT 15-17 
#### Basic Responses
   * 3♦, 3♥, 3♠: shortness, other majors usually have 4 cards, slam interest
   * 3NT: To play
   * 4♣: Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * 4NT: Quantitative

#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit (Garbage Stayman).
Usually responder will have a decent 8+ HCPs (assuming a 15-17 1NT range).

Opener rebids:

   * 2♦: no four-card major
   * 2♥: four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠: five spades (possibly with four hearts) or four spades

Responder's rebids after 2♥ or 2♠:
   * 2♠ (over 2♥): four spades, denies four hearts
   * 3♠ (over 2♥) or 3♥ (over 2♠): forcing raise, slam interest, requests cue bid
   * 3 of that major: invitational
   * 4 of that major: signoff

Responder's rebids after any response:
   * 2NT: invitational, not necessarily with an unbid major
   * 3♣, 3♦: five cards, slam interest
   * 3NT: signoff with an unbid major (choice of games)
   * 4♣, 4♦, 4♥ (over 2♠): splinter
   * 4NT: quantitative

#### 3♣ Puppet Stayman
3♣ is a game-forcing artificial bid that is used when responder has a three and/or four card major and is looking for an eight card fit with opener.
It is on over 1NT and 2NT openings.

Opener rebids:
   * 3♦: no five-card major and at least one four-card major
   * 3♥ or 3♠: five of that major
   * 3NT: no four-card or five-card major

After 3♦:
   * 3♥ or 3♠: four of the other major
   * 3NT: signoff
   * 4♣: 4 of both majors
   * 4♦ or 4♥: Texas Transfer - usually six cards and three of the other major
   * 4NT: quantitative

After 3 of a major:
   * 3NT: signoff
   * 4♣: Gerber (key card if applicable)
   * 4♦: Mild slam try
   * 4 of that major: signoff
   * 4 of the other major: Strong slam try, requests cue bids
   * 4NT: quantitative

#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major.
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦: transfer to hearts
   * 2♥: transfer to spades

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥: normal acceptance of the transfer
   * 3♥: 17 points and four-card heart support

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit,
that is natural and game forcing.
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥; 2♠
   * Pass: content to play 2♠
   * 2NT: invitational with a five-card suit
      * Pass or 3♠: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * 3♣, 3♦: natural (4+), slam interest
   * 3NT: asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠
   * 4NT: quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit
   * 5NT: pick a slam (6♠ or 6NT)
   * 6♠: to play

#### Single-suited Major Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major.
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):

   * 4♦: transfer to hearts
   * 4♥: transfer to spades

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer,
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents.
The following shows how they are used with strong NT (15-17) openings.

   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Invitational with a six-card suit (would make a 1 over 1 bid): Jacoby, raise to 3; Opener rebids:
      * pass: minimum
      * 3NT (rare - usually requires three cards and a balanced hand) or 4M: maximum
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Two options:
      * Jacoby, raise to 4 in suit (balanced)
      * Jacoby, jump in another suit (splinter)
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Two options:
      * Texas, 4NT (Blackwood) OR 
      * Jacoby, other major (requests cue bids)
   * Pick a Slam: Texas, 5NT

It is rare, but a direct bid of 4♠ or 6♠ is to play and is only used when your hand is not amenable to transferring (for example, an unprotected king).

#### 5-5 Majors
When using the Jacoby transfer, it is possible to show 5-5 in the majors 
with a number of hand types.

   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass: bust
   * 1NT - 2♦; 2♥ - 2♠: invitational
   * 1NT - 2♥; 2♠ - 3♥: game forcing

#### Smolen 5-4 or better in the Majors
If responder is weak, transfer to the five-card major and pass.
Otherwise use a Stayman to show 5-4 in the majors as follows:

1NT — 2♣; 2♦
   * 2♥ or 2♠: that major, invitational
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing

Over 2NT, a similar system applies but there are no invitational bids:

2NT — 3♣; 3♦
   * pass: weak  (5-4=4=0 distribution)
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing

Smolen does not apply over 3NT.

#### After Opponent's Double 
* All systems are on.
* Redouble: long minor (relay to 2♣, pass or correct)

#### After Opponent's 2♣ Overcall
All systems are on after 2♣. Double of 2♣ is Stayman.

#### After Opponent's Overcall of 2♦ or Higher
Over any overcall of 2♦ or higher:
* double: Penalty at the 2-level, Negative at the 3-level
* suit bid of an unshown suit: to play (less than invitational values)
* suit bid of a shown suit: takeout
* 2NT through 3♥: Transfer to the next higher suit, invitational or better values
   * Transfer to opponent's suit: Stayman
   * 3♣ after 2NT (unusual) overcall: Stayman
* 3♠: Asks for a stopper
* 3NT: To play
* 4♣: Gerber
* 4♦ or 4♥ (through 4♣): Texas Transfer, or splinter slam try if transfer would be into opponent's suit

Note: This system is influenced by Richard Pavlicek's [system](http://rpbridge.net/7g67.htm)

The Texas transfer is on through 3♣. In other words it must be a jump.

### 2NT and 3NT 
 Stayman and Jacoby transfers for the majors are used.

#### 2NT 20-21
   * 3♣: Puppet Stayman
   * 3♦, 3♥: Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively
   * 3♠: Relay to 3NT, to play or to show a good hand with a minor
   * 3NT: 5♠ + 3♥, no slam interest, pass or correct
      * If this bid is in error and opener bids 4 of a major, 4NT is "oops"
   * 4♣: Gerber (ace asking)
   * 4NT: Quantitative for 6NT
   * 5NT: Pick a Slam

#### 3NT 25-27
   * 4♣: Stayman
   * 4♦, 4♥: Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively
   * 4NT: Quantitative for 6NT
   * 5NT: Pick a Slam

## Major Openings 
Normally open five-card majors in all seats.

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.
### 1♠ Over 1♥
Since the immediate objective is to support with support, 
1♠ must be skipped in favor of heart support without invitational values.

#### After any Non-Supporting Rebid by Opener
   - pass: minimum, 4 or 5 spades
   - 2♠: minimum, 6+ spades
   - 2NT: 4 spades, 11-12 HCP
   - 3♥: invitational, 3-card limit raise, usually 5 spades
   - 3♠: As per 1 over 1 system
   - 3NT: 4 spades, 13-15 HCP
   - 4♥: Game-forcing, minimum hand
   - 4♠: To play, 7+ spades
   - 4NT: quantitative, 16-17 HCP

#### After 1NT Rebid
   - 2♣ or 2♦: See New Minor Forcing below
   - 2♥: preference (rare, 2 hearts and concern about NT)

#### After 2♣ or 2♦ Rebid
   - raise minor: invitational
   - other minor: See Fourth Suit Forcing below
   - 2♥: preference (2 hearts and no more than 3 of the minor)

### NT Responses 
#### 1NT Semi-Forcing
1NT typically shows 6–12 points and is used in a number of circumstances:
   * No support for the major opened
   * A three-card limit raise
   * A bust hand with otherwise good trump support (too weak for a direct raise)

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

Opener is expected to bid a lower ranking 4-card suit and may pass without one.

Responder can sign off or invite game with the rebid
   * other 2-level bid: weak hand, sign-off (opener may raise 1♠-1NT;2m-2♥ with 5=4-0-4 distribution and a good hand)
   * 2 of major: sign-off (2-card support or hand too weak for a direct raise)
   * 2♠ after 1♥-1NT;2m: good support of minor (impossible spade)
   * single raise of minor: good support (could be weak especially if 2♠ is available)
   * 2NT: balanced invite (11-12)
   * 3♥ after 1♠-1NT;2♥: invitational
   * 3X: invitational (usually a 6-card suit)
   * 3 of major: three-card limit raise

### Raises 
The following assumes a 1♥ opening but the system over 1♠ is similar. 
#### Jacoby 2NT
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening:

   * 2NT: Game-forcing raise (13+ dummy points, 4+ trumps, all hand patterns). 
Asks opener to describe his hand to help responder evaluate slam prospects.

      * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: singleton or void in that suit.
      * 4♥: minimum hand.
      * 3NT: medium hand (15–17).
      * 3♥: maximum hand (18+).
	  * 4♣, 4♦, 4♠: 5-card suit with two of the top three honors.
	  
This treatment is off in competition and as a passed hand.
Unless otherwise stated, 2NT is natural.

2NT: 11-12 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.
	  
#### 3NT
3NT: 13-15 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

#### Three-Way Reverse Drury
In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall). 
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following: 
   * 2♣: 4 cards, mixed raise or better
      * 2♦: asking bid
          * sign-off at 2: mixed raise
	  * new suit: limit raise and values in that suit
   * 2♦: 3 card limit raise

   * after either 2♣ or 2♦:
      * 2 of original major: sign-off
      * 2 of other major: 4 cards, full opener, game try
      * 3 of a minor: full opener, values in that suit, game try
   * 2♥ (over 1♠): Standard American 2♥ (about 10HCP, 5 hearts)
   * jump new suit: Fit jump (4 of opener's major AND a good 4 card major or 5 card minor - the jump suit)
   * 3 of the major: 5+ card support, unbalanced (rare)

#### Splinter Raises
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening, a double jump shows 13+ dummy points,
4+ card support, and shortness in the suit bid (either a singleton or void).
Opener can explore slam by bidding controls or attempt to sign off by bidding game.
For example:

1♠ — 4♣: game forcing, club shortness

   * 4♦, 4♥: slam interest, first round control (usually ace)
   * 4♠: signoff

Responder shows a void by rebidding the splinter suit:

1♠ — 4♣ 

4♥ — 5♣: void

Opener can also self-splinter with a good hand and 4-card support:

1♣ — 1♠

   * 4♦, 4♥: game forcing, shortness

In competition, splinters are off except for jumps in the opponent's suit.

Note: This is the treatment recommended by Richard Pavlicek as described in this [quiz](http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/quiz.pl?5h4100).

#### Fit Jumps
As a passed hand, responder may jump shift to show an invitational hand (9-11 HCP), 4+card support, a good 5+card side suit. 
Opener may sign off at the three level if the opening was light.

### Jump Shifts 
#### No-fit Jumps
Unless otherwise specified, a jump shift shows a decent hand (usually 9-11 HCP) and good suit (usually 6+ cards) and no fit for opener (two small at most).

1♠
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥: no-fit jump

To show a weaker hand, bid 1NT and attempt to sign off.

1♠ - 1NT; 2♦
   * 2♥, 3♣: sign-off

## Minor Openings - See other document 
## Opener Strong Rebids 
_generally over a major_ 
### Opener 2NT Rebid
When opener's rebid (jump or otherwise) shows a stronger-than-1NT opening (17 or 18-19 HCP),
the following structure applies:

#### 1♦ - 1M; 2NT (similar structure for other combinations)

   * pass: weak hand, 4-card suit
   * 3♣: relay - opener must bid 3♦ 
      * pass, 3♥, 3♠: to play
      * 3NT: slam interest with secondary support in opener's suit
   * 3♦: artificial checkback for unbid major or secondary support (up the line)
   * 3♥, 3♠: Natural, GF
   * 3NT/4NT/5NT/6NT: natural (signoff/quantitative/pick-a-slam/signoff)
   * 4♣: Gerber
   * 4♦, 4♥: Transfer (if logical)
   * raise to 4: 6+ cards, signoff

### Opener Jump Shift
After a 1/1 or 1NT/1 bid, a jump shift shows 19+ total points and an unbalanced hand. 
Usually it shows 5+ cards in the first suit and 4+ in the second suit, 
although it can also show 6-3-3-1 or 4-4-4-1 distribution if the second suit is a minor.
It is forcing to game. 

Responses:
* A rebid at the two-level: 5+ cards in the suit
* 3NT: denies support, extra length, or shape
* new suit: natural, extras, often a first round control
* support of either suit below game: sets trumps and shows extra shape; responder rebids:
   * Suit: first round control
   * Exception: return to first suit (major only): 6-3-3-1 distribution (warning responder from a 4-3 fit)
   * Jump new suit: splinter
* game in either suit: signoff

### Jump to Game
After a 1-level bid and any response by partner:
* a direct jump to game in opener's suit shows a one-suited hand 
that is too strong to preempt and too weak to jump rebid, reverse, or jump-shift.
Responder is expected to pass without support and/or excellent controls.
* a direct jump to game in responder's suit shows a strong balanced hand 
(18-19 HCP), 
generally with 4-card support and a side doubleton or stiff honor.
Responder is expected to continue with a limit hand or better.

### Self-Splinters
The following bids are self-splinters, showing a maximum (usually 17+ HCP), shortness, and game-forcing / slam interest:
   * A double jump-shift after a 1/1 bid
   * A jump shift after a raise
   * A jump shift in a game-forcing auction (suit agreement on the last shown suit, but the hand can be less powerful)

Responder is expected to bid a first round control if possible.
### Reverses
After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit.
It is forcing for one round. 
Bidding one step higher is the only weak responses. 
It is forcing for one round. Opener will usually retreat to the first suit.
The exception is when there is another unbid four-card suit (e.g., 5-0-4-4 distribution).

All other bids by responder are natural and forcing to game. 
## Two Over One 
By an unpassed hand, a two-over-one response shows 13+ points and 4+ cards 
or exactly 3 of opener's major. 
It is forcing to game.

2♥ over 1♠ shows 5+ cards.

2♣ over 1♦ shows 5+ cards and does not deny a 4-card major.

#### Opener's Subsequent Bids
Opener responds naturally to clarify the hand.

   * 2NT: balanced minimum, misfit minimum, or balanced maximum
   * 3NT: intermediate hand (15-17)
   * New suit: 4+ cards (reverse implies extra strength)
   * Jump shift: splinter support of previously bid suit
   * Rebid of original suit: no better response

## Strong 2♣ 
﻿A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points balanced, 8 1/2+ tricks in a major, or 9 1/2+ tricks in a minor.

Responses:

2♣:
   * 2♦: conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural and game forcing with a minimum of 8 HCP and
a five-card suit with two of the top three honors
   * 2NT: 8+ HCP, balanced (systems off)

After a 2♦ response, opener rebids naturally:
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural, forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor
   * 2NT: 22-23 points (see responses for 2NT opening above)
   * 3NT: 24-25 points (see responses for 3NT opening above)
   * 4NT: 28+ points

In response to a suit rebid, responder indicates strength.

2♣ — 2♦; 2♥:
   * 2♠, 3♦: natural, game force
   * 3♣: artificial (cheaper minor), very weak (0-4, not an ace)
   * 3NT: 5-7 points, balanced
   * 3♥: positive support, requests cue bid sequence
   * 4♥: fair support, discouraging slam

2♣ — 2♦; 3♦:
   * 3♥: "cheaper minor" (instead of 4♣)
   * others: same as above

### Over Interference
The 2♣ opening automatically creates a forcing auction.
All bids are natural and positive (game-forcing). 
All doubles show a bust hand (0-4 HCP, no A). 
All passes are forcing, semi-positive, and waiting.
## Weak Two Bids of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ 
A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality 
and roughly 4–10 HCP, but flexible based on vulnerability and position. 
On rare occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. 
It is possible to open a weak two with a poor seven-card suit 
(not good enough to open with at the three level)
but in MP scoring three level bids are pretty lenient. 

Responses:
* New suit: forcing
   * Raise of responder's suit: honor-doubleton or better
   * Retreat: no outside strength
   * New suit: strength in that suit 
   * 3NT: solid suit (AKJxxx or better)
* 2NT: forcing, showing game interest (on in competition) 
   * New suit: feature (usually A or K in that suit)
   * Rebid of 3: good suit
   * 3♣: either a feature in clubs or a bad hand; responder may relay 3♦ to inquire further  
   * 3NT: solid suit (AKJxxx or better)
* Any raise: to play, preemptive
* 3NT: to play (typically a good hand with three-card support)

## Slam Bidding 
### Kickback Roman Key-Card 0314
Once suit agreement has been reached (or implied), one step over 4 of the trump suit is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump. 

Kickback KC Asking:
   * 1 step: 0 or 3 keycards
   * 2 steps: 1 or 4 keycards
   * 3 steps: 2 keycards, no queen (of trump) or extra length (QoEL - promises a 10-card fit)
   * 4 steps: 2 keycards, QoEL

_do not show voids_

After a 1 or 2 step response, the Kickback initiator may ask for QoEL by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement) - 4♠; 5♣ - 5♦: Queen ask
      * 5♥: no QoEL
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦: QoEL, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 5NT: QoEL, no kings

A bid of NT is to play, not a queen ask:
   * (diamond suit agreement) - 4♥; 4♠
      * 4NT: to play
      * 5♣: Q ask


#### 5NT (Specific Kings)
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.

### Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over any 1NT OR 2NT by partner, including a rebid of
1NT OR 2NT. Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦: 0 or 3 aces
   * 4♥: 1 or 4 aces
   * 4♠: 2 aces, bad hand
   * 4NT: 2 aces, good hand

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦: 0 or 3 kings
   * 5♥: 1 or 4 kings
   * 5♠: 2 kings, bad hand
   * 5NT: 2 kings, bad hand

### Quantitative 4NT
When suit agreement has not been reached, a bid of 4NT is quantitative (slam invitational).
There are a number of ways to accept the invitation.

4NT quantitative:
   * 5♣: 0 or 4 aces
   * 5♦: 1 ace
   * 5♥: 2 aces
   * 5♠: 3 aces
   * 5NT: pick a slam
   * any 6-bid: suggested place to play (pass or correct)

### 5NT Pick a Slam
A voluntary bid of 5NT is forcing and asks partner to try to pick the best slam available.
There are no hard-and-fast rules here, but possibilities include:
   * bidding a new 4-card suit (looking for a 4-4 fit)
   * supporting partner with mild support (looking for a good 7-card fit)
   * rebidding a previously bid suit with unannounced length and/or strength
   * returning to 6NT with no better options

The asker may continue to bid up the line if completely displeased with the response.

### Voluntary 5-bid
A voluntary bid of 5 of a suit is invitational to slam.
It is used in two circumstances: 
   * If opponents have bid one suit or there is one unbid suit, it asks for second-round control in that suit. Responder:
      * Bids 5NT with an unguarded K to invite an alternative contract of 6NT
	  * Raises to 6 with first or second-round control
	  * Passes otherwise
   * Otherwise, it asks for top trump honors. Responder 
      * Raises to 7 with AK and the Q or extra length
	  * Raises to 6 with at least AJ or KQ
	  * Passes otherwise

## Defensive Bidding 
### Doubles
A double is for takeout over a partscore bid (4♦ or lower). 
In the direct position over a 1-level bid, it shows support for the unbid suits and 
enough strength to warrant getting into the auction 
(usually 10+ points with shortness in opener's suit OR 18+ points and any distribution). 
In the balancing position it can be 2-3 points lighter.

Advancer is expected to bid after a takeout double. 
The Rule of 9 (#cards + #honors + bid level >= 9) is a reasonable guideline to determine when to convert the double to penalty.
With insufficient strength and no compelling suit, a 1NT bid is permissible. 
Unlike in other bidding situations, bid four-card suits highest first. 
In some cases this will allow you to show your second suit and give partner a choice of places to play. 

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational (9-12 declarer points). 
To force for one round, responder cuebids opener’s suit. 
This is forcing to game by an unpassed hand.

Any subsequent bid by doubler shows significant extras and is strongly invitational to game. 
If advancer has jumped, then a new suit or NT bid by doubler is forcing to game.

Over opening game bids (4♥ or higher), a double is for penalty.
However, advancer may pull the double with undisclosed distribution and/or poor defensive values.
### Responsive Doubles
After an opponent bids at the one level, partner doubles for takeout,
and the other opponent raises, a double by advancer is responsive. 
This allows the original doubler to be declarer and to pick the preferred suit.

Responsive Doubles are on through 4♦ but off after a preemptive opening.
### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 8–16 points (double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural. 

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid two suits is natural in either suit.

### NT Overcalls
With appropriate strength and a stopper in the opponent's suit,
you may make a NT overcall.
All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

#### Direct Position (1X-?)
   * 10-14 HCP: pass or double then pass
   * 15-18 HCP: 1NT
   * 19-21 HCP: double then bid NT
   * 22-24 HCP: double then jump NT
   
#### Balancing Position (1X-p-p-?)
   * 12-15 HCP: 1NT
   * 16-18 HCP: double then bid NT
   * 19-21 HCP: double then jump in NT
   * 22-24 HCP: 3NT
   * 2NT is unusual (see below)

#### 2-Level (2X-? or 1X-p-2X-?)
   * 15-18 HCP: 2NT
   * 19-21 HCP: 3NT
   * 22-24 HCP: double then 3NT
      
#### 3-Level (3X-? or any-p-3X-?)
   * 15-18 HCP: pass or 3NT
   * 19-24 HCP: 3NT

### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT promises at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 

(1♦) - 2NT: hearts and clubs

The strength is wide-ranging.

Responses:
   * Cheapest in either suit: to play
   * Jump in minor: invitational
   * Cue: invitational in a major only
   * 4th suit: natural, sign-off
   * Game in major: to play

Note: Unusual 2NT may be off in the reopening seat (see NT Overcalls above).

### Unusual 4NT
In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Over an opening 4♠ bid, 4NT is takeout with at least two places to play.
### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

   * If the opening is in a minor suit, the cuebid shows the majors; 
   * If the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

The strength is wide-ranging.
When vulnerable, it is usually best to avoid very weak hands. 
When non-vulnerable, the low-end range is much wider. 

#### Responses to a Minor Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
1. 2NT: Invitational
   * 3♣: bad hand, better hearts
   * 3♦: bad hand, better spades
   * 3M: good hand, better in that major
   * 4M: sign-off

#### Responses to a Major Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
1. 2NT: invitational in minor
   * 3m: natural, bad hand
   * 3♥: clubs, not bad hand
   * 3♠: diamonds, not bad hand   
   * 3NT: good hand, stopper
   * 4♣/4♦: natural, good hand
1. 3♣: sign-off (pass or correct)
1. 3♦: invitational in major
2. Jump in major: Weak if below game

### vs. Strong NT (maximum 15+ HCPs) 
### Meckwell vs. Strong 1NT
Meckwell features multiple ways to show single-suited or 5-4 hands.  
   * double: long minor or both majors or 18+ HCP 
   * 2♣: clubs and a major
   * 2♦: diamonds and a major
   * 2♥: natural, rebiddable
   * 2♠: natural, rebiddable
   * 2NT: minors

After double, Advancer is expected to relay to 2♣. 
Responses to 2♣:
   * pass: single-suited with clubs
   * 2♦: single-suited with diamonds
   * 2♥: both majors
   * 2♠: both majors, but spades are stronger
   * 3♣: natural, rebiddable

After 2♣ or 2♦, Advancer may pass or bid 2♥. 
Overcaller may pass or correct to 2♠.
### vs. Weak NT (maximum less than 15 HCPs) 
### Landy vs 1NT
#### Unpassed Hand
Landy is a simple defense to 1NT with only one artificial bid:
   * Double: Penalty
   * 2♣: Majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
   * 2NT: Minors
   * Others: Natural

After 2♣, advancer generally bids the better major.
   * pass: No major, long clubs
   * 2♦: No preference
   * 2♥, 2♠: Weak, sign-off
   * 2NT: Forcing, invitational in either major
   * 3♥, 3♠: Limit raise
   * 4♥, 4♠: To play

#### Passed Hand
Since it is impossible to have a penalty double as a passed hand,
double is a relay to 2♣.
### Overcalls of Strong Openings
Against any strong opening (usually 2♣ or 1♣), 
an overcall is a transfer to the next higher suit.

## Preemptive Bids
Opening suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and 
may be very weak particularly in first or third seat. 
In a major they typically show seven cards. 
In a minor (particularly clubs) the rules are less strict especially in Matchpoints and/or non-vulnerable. 
   
Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:
   * more than one outside trick
   * a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better
   * a void in a minor

Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.

Raises are best used with an unbalanced hand and decent trump support.
## Competitive Bidding 
### New Suits
In a competitive sequence, new suits by a passed or unpassed hand are non-forcing.
To make a forcing bid, consider a cue bid, DSI double, or 2NT (if that is forcing).

Jump shifts are weak, showing a similar hand to a sound preempt.

### Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows a limit raise or better:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = limit raise or better.

Note: If playing inverted minors ON in competition, then that treatment supercedes this one.

### Jump Raise
When using this treatment, a jump raise is weak / competitive.

1♠ - (2♣) - 3♠ = weak, 4+ card support

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+  

### Mixed Raise
After an overcall, a jump cue by advancer shows a mixed raise:
   * (1♣) - 1♠ - (p) - 3♣: mixed raise

### With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

#### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (11-12 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

### Against Conventions
After partner opens in a suit and a conventional bid by the opponents shows one known suit, 
a cue bid shows a good raise, a double shows a good hand without support, and other bids are weak. 
For example:

1♠ — (2♠:Michaels) 
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: weak
   * 3♥: Limit raise or better in spades.
   * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

If the conventional bid shows two known suits, 
there are two cue bids available and the second shows the fourth suit. 
For example:

1♣ — (2NT:Unusual) 
   * 3♣, 3♠: weak
   * 3♦: Limit raise or better in clubs.
   * 3♥: 10+HCP, 5+ spades
   * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

### Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double:

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * 2NT = limit raise (at least 10 points) — or better.
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, but it is better to make a more
descriptive bid of 1♥, 1♠, or 2NT with the appropriate hand.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

A responder’s jump shift after a double is to play:

1♦ — (Double) — 2♥, 2♠, 3♣ = six-plus card suit, like a weak two-bid or
preemptive three-bid.
### Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major. 
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level. 
With insufficient high-card strength for a free bid, double may also be used with a five-card or longer suit.

   * 1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.
   * 1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).
   * 1♦ — (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–6 points.
   * 1♠ — (4♦) — Double = four hearts and 10+ points or five hearts and 8-10 points.

If both majors are bid, then a double shows both minors.
   * 1♥ — (1♠) — Double = 4-4 or better in the minors.

When the opponents overcall a minor over a minor at the two-level or higher, 
a double shows at least one four-card major 
and at least two places to play.

   * 1♦ — (2♣) — Double = at least one four-card major.
   * 1♣ — (2♦) — Double = at least one four-card major.

If opener bids the a major you cannot support, 
rebid opener's first suit or NT to imply the other major.

### Support Doubles
Unless overruled elsewhere, after opener bids a suit, 
responder bids another suit, and RHO overcalls, 
a double shows three-card support for responder. 
If RHO doubles, a redouble shows 3-card support for responder.
Eschewing the support double shows 4-card support.

Support Doubles are on through 2♠.

### Card-Showing Doubles
In a competitive auction below game, a double is card-showing and major-oriented. 
Partner is requested to do something intelligent, such as:
  * Show secondary support for a previously bid suit
  * Rebid an extra-long or extra-strong suit
  * Bid a previously unbid four-card suit
  * Bid NT with at least one good stopper
  * Convert to penalty (usually with a decent four cards)

### Competitive 2NT
In a competitive auction below game, a 2NT bid is artificial (takeout) and minor-oriented.
Partner is expected to bid the logical minor at the cheapest level.
When 2NT is available as an artificial bid, 
a direct bid of a minor is invitational.

### Penalty Doubles
A double is unequivocally for penalty in the following cases:
  * After a game contract by the opponents
  * After a natural NT bid by any player
  * After a pass
  * After two previous doubles by either partner
  * After partner has bid or doubled over an opposing preempt and preempter's partner has raised

#### Lightner Doubles
A double of a NT or slam contract is Lightner, asking for a specific lead such as:
  * dummy's first bid suit
  * a suit doubler has not shown

#### Lead-Directing Doubles
In fourth position or after a pass, double of an artificial bid is lead-directing. 
To make the bid, doubler must be confident that:
   * the lead will be helpful
   * the opponents will not be able to make the contract redoubled

### Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.

## Defensive Leads and Signals 
#### Carding
First discard is attitude for that suit. (See "Signals" below.)
#### Leads
Leads are: 
* top of touching honors and interior sequences.
* A from A–K–x-(x...)
   * Q from partner either is singleton or promises J
* K from A-K tight or A-K-J-(x)
* Q from A-K-Q-x-(x...) - requests count
* Top of all doubletons (including honors)
* Against suits:
   * 3rd best (follow with a lower card to show odd, higher to show even)
* Against NT
   * Bottom from H-x-x, top from x–x–x (BOSTON)
   * 4th best from H-x-x-x(-x...)
   * 2nd best from x-x-x-x (show original 4th best at next opportunity)

#### Signals (Upside-Down Count and Attitude)
   1. Attitude (low encourages)
   1. Count (low = even)
   1. Suit preference (high = higher suit)

#### Special Carding
A jack requests a shift to an unexpected suit.

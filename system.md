
This branch contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes the bridge system
used by Jeff Yutzler and Donna Hickling. 
It is a 2 over 1 game force (no exceptions) with other commonly used conventions.
It is suitable for advancing club players.

## General Approach 
Two-over-one game forcing with five-card majors

Strong forcing opening: 2♣;
## Balanced Opening Hands 
Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is particularly strong. 
Semi-balanced hands with either 5-4-2-2 or 6-3-2-2 distribution 
may be treated as balanced if the doubletons are Qx or better. 

A hand may be upgraded 1 point for a long suit with good texture (e.g., QJT9x)
and downgraded 1 point for a 4-3-3-3 hand with poor texture (e.g., AJx-KJx-Axx-Qxxx).

The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:

   * 12-14: Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT
   * 15-17: Open 1NT
   * 18-19: Open 1 of a suit, jump NT
   * 20-21: Open 2NT
   * 22-24: Open 2♣, rebid NT
   * 25-27: Open 3NT
   * 28+: Open 2♣, jump NT

### 1NT 15-17 
#### Basic Responses
   * 2♣: Stayman (also for invitational hands)
   * 3NT: sign-off
   * 4♣: Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * 4NT: natural, quantitative invite to 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit (Garbage Stayman).
Usually responder will have 8+ HCPs (assuming a 15-17 1NT range).

Opener rebids:

   * 2♦: no four-card major
   * 2♥: four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠: five spades (possibly with four hearts) or four spades

Responder's rebids after 2♥ or 2♠:
   * 2♠ (over 2♥) or 3♥ (over 2♠): forcing raise, slam interest, requests cue bid
   * 3 of that major: invitational
   * 4 of that major: signoff

Responder's rebids after any response:
   * 2NT: invitational with an unbid major
   * 3♣, 3♦: five cards, slam interest
   * 3♠ (over 2♥), 4♦, 4♥ (over 2♠): unused
   * 3NT: signoff with an unbid major (choice of games)
   * 4♣: Gerber (key card if over a major)
   * 4NT: quantitative

#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major.
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦: transfer to hearts
   * 2♥: transfer to spades

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥: normal acceptance of the transfer
   * 3♥: 17 points and four-card heart support

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit,
that is natural and game forcing.
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥; 2♠
   * Pass: content to play 2♠
   * 2NT: invitational with a five-card suit
      * Pass or 3♠: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * 3♣, 3♦: natural (4+), slam interest
   * 3NT: asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠
   * 4NT: quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit
   * 5NT: Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors)
   * 6♠: pick a slam (pass or correct)

#### Single-suited Major Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major.
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):

   * 4♦: transfer to hearts
   * 4♥: transfer to spades

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer,
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents.
The following shows how they are used with strong NT (15-17) openings.

   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Invitational with a six-card suit (would make a 1 over 1 bid): Jacoby, raise to 3; Opener rebids:
      * pass: minimum
      * 3NT (rare - usually requires three cards and a balanced hand) or 4M: maximum
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Two options:
      * Jacoby, raise to 4 in suit (balanced)
      * Jacoby, jump in another suit (splinter)
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Two options:
      * Texas, 4NT (Blackwood) OR 
      * Jacoby, other major (requests cue bids)
   * Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors): Texas, 5NT

It is rare, but a direct bid of 4♠ or 6♠ is to play and is only used when your hand is not amenable to transferring (for example, an unprotected king).

#### 2-level:
A transfer at the 2-level is used with certain hands with the majors.
   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass: bust
   * 2♦(transfer) followed by 2♠: 6 hearts, slam try (request to cue bid)
   * 2♥(transfer) followed by 3♥: 6 spades, slam try (request to cue bid)

#### 3-level: 5-5 hands
The 3-level is used to show most 5-5 hands.

   * 3♣: 5-5 minors, weak
   * 3♦: 5-5 minors, game forcing
   * 3♥: 5-5 majors, invitational
   * 3♠: 5-5 majors, choice of games

#### 4-level
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

#### Smolen 5-4 or better in the Majors
If responder is weak, transfer to the five-card major and pass.
Otherwise use a Stayman to show 5-4 in the majors as follows:

1NT — 2♣; 2♦
   * pass: weak (5-4=4=0 distribution)
   * 2♥ or 2♠: that major, invitational
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Over 2NT, a similar system applies but there are no invitational bids:

2NT — 3♣; 3♦
   * pass: weak  (5-4=4=0 distribution)
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Smolen does not apply over 3NT.

#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor.

   * 2♠ = transfer to clubs
      * 2NT: preacceptance (good support)
      * 3♣: normal response
   * 2NT = transfer to diamonds
      * 3♣: preacceptance (good support)
      * 3♦: normal response

After the transfer, responder can bid again to show extra length or strength:
   * New suit: shortness, mild slam try
   * 3NT: balanced, mild slam try
   * Raise to 4: invitational
   * Raise to 5: sign-off

When using this treatment, responder bids 2♣ (Stayman) with any game invitational hand. 
A rebid of 2NT over a 2♦ or 2♠ response shows an invitational hand that may or may not have a four-card major.
#### When Opponents Double
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

1NT — (Double) — 2♣ = Stayman

1NT — (Double) — 2♦ = transfer to hearts

With a bad hand and no 5-card suit, redouble to scramble to safety, looking for a 4-4 or 4-3 fit.

1NT — (Double) — Redouble = Rescue - weak with no five-card suit (opener bids a four-card suit, pass or correct).

Otherwise pass and let opener reopen the bidding.

1NT — (Double) — pass - (pass) = Forcing: opener either bids a 5-card suit or redoubles.
Responder passes the redouble with 7+ (possibly less)
or bids a 5-card minor.
#### Over 2♣
Jacoby Transfers are on over 2♣.

Double of an artificial 2♣ = Stayman, does not imply invitational or better values.

#### Over Other Overcalls
Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents is negative, showing at least one major.
It is primarily for takeout, but may be converted to penalty with the right hand.

Cue bid of opponent's natural suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

Suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.

   * 2♥, 2♠ = To play, 5+.
   * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.

#### Interference With Conventions
If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

For example: 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double)
   * Redouble: Suggestion to play (rare)
   * Pass: Only two hearts
      * Redouble: retransfer
      * Others: same as without interference
   * 2♥: Real fit for hearts

The Texas transfer is on through 3♣. In other words it must be a jump.

### 2NT and 3NT 
Stayman and Jacoby transfers for the majors are used.

#### 2NT 20-21
   * 3♣ = Stayman.
   * 3♦, 3♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively.
   * 4♣ = Gerber (ace asking).
   * 4NT: Quantitative for 6NT
   * 5NT: Quantitative for 7NT

#### 3NT 25-27
   * 4♣ = Stayman.
   * 4♦, 4♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively
   * 4NT: Quantitative for 6NT
   * 5NT: Quantitative for 7NT

#### 4NT Blackwood Opening
An opening of 4NT shows a rare hand that is solid except for aces or kings.
Standard Blackwood responses are used.
## Major Openings 
Normally open five-card majors in all seats.

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.
### 1♠ Over 1♥
Since the immediate objective is to support with support, 
1♠ must be skipped in favor of heart support without game-forcing values.

#### After any Non-Supporting Rebid by Opener
   - pass: minimum, 4 or 5 spades
   - 2♠: minimum, 6+ spades
   - 2NT: 4 spades, 11-12 HCP
   - 3♥: Game-forcing, good hand
   - 3♠: As per 1 over 1 system
   - 3NT: 4 spades, 13-15 HCP
   - 4♥: Game-forcing, minimum hand
   - 4♠: To play, 7+ spades
   - 4NT: quantitative, 16-17 HCP

#### After 1NT Rebid
   - 2♣ or 2♦: New Minor Forcing 
   - 2♥: preference (rare, 2 hearts and concern about NT)

#### After 2♣ or 2♦ Rebid
   - raise minor: Invitational
   - other minor: New Minor Forcing
   - 2♥: preference (2 hearts and no more than 3 of the minor)

### NT Responses 
#### 1NT Forcing
1NT typically shows 6–12 points and is used in a number of circumstances:
   * No support for the major opened
   * A three-card limit raise
   * A bust hand with otherwise good trump support (too weak for a direct raise)

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

It is 100% forcing by an unpassed hand so responder must be prepared for a three-card response or a rebid with only five cards.


Responder can sign off or invite game with the rebid
   * other 2-level bid: weak hand, sign-off (opener may raise 1♠-1NT;2m-2♥ with 5=4-0-4 distribution and a good hand)
   * 2 of major: sign-off (2-card support or hand too weak for a direct raise)
   * 2♠ after 1♥-1NT;2m: good support of minor (impossible spade)
   * single raise of minor: good support (could be weak especially if 2♠ is available)
   * 2NT: balanced invite (11-12)
   * 3♥ after 1♠-1NT;2♥: invitational
   * 3X: invitational (usually a 6-card suit)
   * 3 of major: three-card limit raise

### Raises 
#### General
   * 2♥ = three-card support, 7–10 dummy points (strong enough to accept at least one game try).
   * 4♥ = usually five+ cards, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

#### Bergen Raises
   * 3♣ = mixed raise (7-10 dummy points with four or more hearts).
      * 3♦ = game try
   * 3♦ = limit raise (11–12 dummy points with four or more hearts).
   * 3♥ = weak raise (6 or fewer dummy points with four or more hearts).

#### Passed Hands
Bergen Raises are off. See Drury section if applicable.

#### In Competition
Bergen Raises are on over a double (Redouble implies no fit) 
but off in competition. After an overcall:
   * 3♥ = weak raise (10 or fewer dummy points with four or more hearts).
   * 4♥ = usually five+ cards, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.
   * Cue = Limit Raise or better (at least a good 10 dummy points and three hearts)

#### Jacoby 2NT
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening:

   * 2NT: Game-forcing raise (13+ dummy points, 4+ trumps, no singleton or void).
Asks opener to describe his hand to help responder evaluate slam prospects.

      * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: singleton or void in that suit.
      * 4♥: minimum balanced hand.
      * 3NT: medium hand (16-18 total points).
      * 3♥: maximum hand (19+ total points).
	  * 4♣, 4♦, 4♠: 5-card suit with two of the top three honors.

This treatment is also on after a takeout double but is off as a passed hand (see below).

#### 3NT
3NT: 13-15 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

#### 2NT (passed hand only)
2NT: 11-12 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.
#### Splinter Raises
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening, a double jump shows 13+ dummy points,
4+ card support, and shortness in the suit bid (either a singleton or void).
Opener can explore slam by bidding controls or attempt to sign off by bidding game.
For example:

1♠ — 4♣: game forcing, club shortness

   * 4♦, 4♥: slam interest, first round control (usually ace)
   * 4♠: signoff

Responder shows a void by rebidding the splinter suit:

1♠ — 4♣ 

4♥ — 5♣: void

Opener can also self-splinter with a good hand and 4-card support:

1♣ — 1♠

   * 4♦, 4♥: game forcing, shortness

In competition, splinters are off except for jumps in the opponent's suit.

Note: This is the treatment recommended by Richard Pavlicek as described in this [quiz](http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/quiz.pl?5h4100).

#### Two Way Reverse Drury
In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall). 
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following: 
   * 2 of a minor shows a limit raise
      * 2♣: 3 card support
      * 2♦: 4+ card support
	  * 3 of the major: 5+ card support, unbalanced (rare)
   * Opener clarifies strength with the rebid   
      * 2 of the major: sign-off
	  * 3 of the major: good hand, requests cue bid
	  * 4 of the major: sign-off
      * 2♦ over 2♣ or 2♥ over 2♦: full opener, game try
	  * 2♥ over 1♠-2♣: 4 hearts, game try or better
	  * 2♠ over 1♥-2♣: 4 spades, game try or better

### Jump Shifts 
#### Weak Jump Shift
A jump shift in the other major shows a weak hand (less than invitational values) and 6+ cards. Opener must pass without good support.

1♠
   * 3♥: weak

To show an invitational hand in the other major or a minor, bid 1NT and then jump or reverse.

1♠ — 1NT — 2♦
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥: invitational

With a weak hand and a minor, you must pass if you have a singleton or void in opener's suit.
With a doubleton, you can bid 1NT and pass, correct, or sign off in opener's suit.
## Minor Openings 
﻿A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4=4=3=2 shape which should be opened 1♦. 
With 9+ cards in the minors, generally open the longer minor first. 
If the minor is clubs, make sure you have a suitable rebid after partner's response.

### Raises 
Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.
Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better) 
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive). When vulnerable, a jump raise should be 
sound (8-9 dummy points) but when non-vulnerable it is much more wide-ranging.

1♦ - 2♦

   * 2♥, 2♠: stopper
   * 2NT: balanced minimum, side suits stopped
   * 3♦: unbalanced minimum
   * 3NT: 18-19, side suits stopped
   * 4♦: unbalanced maximum (GF, asks for control bids)

Inverted raises are off in all competition.
### One Over One 
A 1/1 bid shows 6+ dummy points and either a 5+ card suit or no lower 4-card suit.
Bid 4-card suits up the line
but with two 5+-card suits bid the highest first.

#### 1♦
A 1♦ response to 1♣ shows one of the following hand types:
   * Rebiddable diamonds
   * A game force with at least one 4-card major
   * A balanced 6-8 points and a desire for opener to declare 1NT.

### NT Responses 
#### 1NT
1NT over 1♣: balanced 8–10 HCP, no four-card major. (With 6-8 HCP, bid 1♦ instead so that opener can declare 1NT if possible.)
Over 1♦ the range is wider (6-10 HCP).
It is not forcing, but opener is expected to bid with a strong and/or unbalanced hand.

#### 2NT
2NT: invitational balanced hand (11-12 HCP), no four-card major.

#### 3NT
3NT: game-value balanced hand (13-15 HCP), no four-card major.

#### 4NT
4NT: quantitative balanced hand (16-18 HCP), no four-card major.
### Opener Rebids 
Opener’s rebids are natural and standard.
Unless the hand qualifies for a [Strong Rebid](#strong-rebids), 
make one of the following bids.

   * pass: partner is a passed hand, you have a minimum with 3-card support 
or a sub-minimum with 4-card support
   * 1NT: balanced with 2 or 3-card support for partner, 
or unbalanced with a stiff A or K in partner's suit and no other alternative
   * rebid suit: 6-cards or strong 5
   * new suit (non-reverse): 4-cards
   * raise to 2: minimum, usually 4-cards, though good 3-card support is acceptable if notrump is not
   * jump raise: invitational, 17-18 dummy points
   * 3NT: to play, usually long running minor
   * double jump shift: game force, splinter
   * jump to game: 18-19 balanced

### Responder Rebids 
If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

#### Sign-off
Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

Example: 1♦-1♠;2♣:
   * Pass
   * 2♦: 2-3 hearts, likely misfit
   * 2♠: 6+ spades

There is one exception to the rule that new suits are forcing: 1♦—1♠;1NT:
   * 2♥: sign-off - opener must pass or correct (bust with 5-4 or better distribution)
   
#### Inviting Game
Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, jump in a bid suit, new minor:

Example: 1♦-1♠;2♣:
   * 2NT, 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: 11–12 points, inviting game.

#### Forcing to Game
Bids available for forcing to game:
   * Fourth suit
   * Jump or reverse in new suit
   * New Minor Forcing followed by a rebid of previously bid suit
      * For example, 1♣-1♠;1NT-2♦;2♥-2♠ shows a game-forcing hand and a 6-card suit

Opener can sign off in game or make a slam try. 
4NT is Blackwood (see [Slam Bidding](#slam-bidding)) only if suit agreement has been established. 
Otherwise it is quantitative, asking responder to proceed with a maximum. 
Suit bids usually show controls.

#### New Minor Forcing
A new minor suit at the responder's second bid or later is forcing for one round and thus
is invitational at the 2-level and game forcing at the 3-level.
When more than one minor is available (1♥-1♠;1NT-2m), 
it tends to show a stopper for NT.

Example: 1♣-1♠;1NT (or 2♣)-2♦ (forcing)

After New Minor Forcing, opener must describe his hand further.
* 2 of responder's suit: 3-card support, minimum
* 3 of responder's suit: 3-card support, extras (preacceptance)
* 2 of other major: 4 cards, minimum
* 3 of other major: 4 cards, extras (preacceptance)
* 2NT: minimum
* 3NT: to play (maximum)

If opener has rebid 1NT, 
rebids should be designed to find a suit contract.
* raise new minor: extras, stopper, forcing to 3NT or higher

If opener has rebid his suit, 
rebids should be designed to find a 3NT contract
* raise other minor: 4-cards, extras
* rebid opener's suit: retreat (minimum, no stopper in new minor)

## Two Over One 
By an unpassed hand, a two-over-one response shows 13+ points and 4+ cards 
or exactly 3 of opener's major. 
It is forcing to game.

2♥ over 1♠ shows 5+ cards.

2♣ over 1♦ shows 5+ cards and does not deny a 4-card major.

#### Opener's Subsequent Bids
Opener responds naturally to clarify the hand.

   * 2NT: balanced minimum, misfit minimum, or balanced maximum
   * 3NT: intermediate hand (15-17)
   * New suit: 4+ cards (reverse implies extra strength)
   * Jump shift: splinter support of previously bid suit
   * Rebid of original suit: no better response

## Game Tries 
#### Help Suit Game Try

Once any major suit is raised from 1 to 2 (declaring suit agreement), a new suit is a game try.
The idea is to identify a suit Qxx or better that would benefit from fitting honors. 
One may bid game, sign off, or make another game try.

When this treatment is used, other bids change their meanings.
   * 2NT shows a balanced hand
   * 3 of the trump suit shows bad trumps but otherwise a good hand

## Strong Rebids 
### Jump Rebid
After an opening at the 1-level and nearly any response by partner, a jump rebid shows at least 16 total points and a good six card suit.
The suit should be strong enough to play opposite a small singleton. Responses:
* pass: bad fit, bad hand
* 3NT or raise to game: to play
* Other suit: cue bid in support of opener's suit
* 4NT: Blackwood (see [Slam Bidding](#slam-bidding))

### Opener Jump Shift
After a 1/1 or 1NT/1 bid, a jump shift shows 19+ total points and an unbalanced hand. 
Usually it shows 5+ cards in the first suit and 4+ in the second suit, 
although it can also show 6-3-3-1 or 4-4-4-1 distribution if the second suit is a minor.
It is forcing to game. 

Responses:
* A rebid at the two-level: 5+ cards in the suit
* 3NT: denies support, extra length, or shape
* new suit: natural, extras, often a first round control
* support of either suit below game: sets trumps and shows extra shape; responder rebids:
   * Suit: first round control
   * Exception: return to first suit (major only): 6-3-3-1 distribution (warning responder from a 4-3 fit)
   * Jump new suit: splinter
* game in either suit: signoff

### Opener Jump to 2NT
Opener's jump to 2NT shows a stronger-than-1NT opening (18-19 HCP).
Responder's rebids are mostly natural.

#### 1m - 1M; 2NT...

   * pass: weak hand, 4-card suit
   * rebid suit: weak hand (signoff), 5+card suit
   * retreat to opener's minor: weak hand (signoff), 4-card major,
   5+ cards in opener's suit (or 4-4-4-1 distribution)
   * new minor: 5 card suit and/or unbid four card major, game-forcing
   * 3♥: 5-5 or better, game-forcing or better
   (if 6-5 then looking to signoff at game)
   * 3NT/4NT/5NT/6NT: natural (signoff/quantitative/pick-a-slam/signoff), 4-card suit
   * 4♣: Gerber
   * 3♠, 4♦, 4♥: 6-5 distribution or better, slam interest
   * raise to 4: 6+ cards, signoff

#### 1♣ - 1♦; 2NT...
Same as the above with the following addition:
   * 3♥, 3♠: 4-card major, game-forcing

### Jump to Game
After a 1-level bid and any response by partner:
* a direct jump to game in opener's suit shows a one-suited hand 
that is too strong to preempt and too weak to jump rebid, reverse, or jump-shift.
Responder is expected to pass without support and/or excellent controls.
* a direct jump to game in responder's suit shows a strong balanced hand 
(18-19 HCP), 
generally with 4-card support and a side doubleton or stiff honor.
Responder is expected to continue with a limit hand or better.

### Reverses
After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit.
It is forcing for one round. 
Responder has two weak responses:
   * A rebid at the two-level shows 5+ cards in the suit
   * 2NT denies 5+ cards

Both of these responses are forcing for one round. 
Without good support, opener will usually retreat to the first suit.
The exception is when there is another unbid four-card suit (e.g., 5-0-4-4 distribution).

All other bids by responder are natural and forcing to game. 
### Self-Splinters
After a 1/1 bid, a double jump-shift shows 17+ HCP 
and shortness in the bid suit.
It is forcing to game. 
Responder is encouraged to bid a first round control if possible.
## Strong 2♣ 
﻿A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points balanced, 8 1/2+ tricks in a major, or 9 1/2+ tricks in a minor.

Responses:

2♣:
   * 2♦: conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural and game forcing with a minimum of 8 HCP and
a five-card suit with two of the top three honors
   * 2NT: 8+ HCP, balanced (systems off)

After a 2♦ response, opener rebids naturally:
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural, forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor
   * 2NT: 22-23 points (see responses for 2NT opening above)
   * 3NT: 24-25 points (see responses for 3NT opening above)
   * 4NT: 28+ points

In response to a suit rebid, responder indicates strength.

2♣ — 2♦; 2♥:
   * 2♠, 3♦: natural, game force
   * 3♣: artificial (cheaper minor), very weak (0-4, not an ace)
   * 3NT: 5-7 points, balanced
   * 3♥: positive support, requests cue bid sequence
   * 4♥: fair support, discouraging slam

2♣ — 2♦; 3♦:
   * 3♥: "cheaper minor" (instead of 4♣)
   * others: same as above

## Weak Two Bids of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ 
A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality 
and roughly 4–10 HCP, but flexible based on vulnerability and position. 
On rare occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. 
It is possible to open a weak two with a poor seven-card suit 
(not good enough to open with at the three level)
but in MP scoring three level bids are pretty lenient. 

Responses:
* New suit: forcing
   * Raise of responder's suit: honor-doubleton or better
   * Retreat: no outside strength
   * New suit: strength in that suit 
   * 3NT: solid suit (AKJxxx or better)
* 2NT: forcing, showing game interest (on in competition) 
   * New suit: feature (usually A or K in that suit)
   * Rebid of 3: no feature
   * 3NT: solid suit (AKJxxx or better)
* Any raise: to play, preemptive
* 3NT: to play (typically a good hand with three-card support)

## Slam Bidding 
### Roman Key-Card Blackwood 1430
Once suit agreement has been reached, 4NT is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump. 

4NT KC Asking:
   * 5♣ = 1 or 4 keycards
   * 5♦ = 3 or 0 keycards
   * 5♥ = 2 keycards, no queen of trump
   * 5♠ = 2 keycards, queen of trump

After a 5♣ or 5♦ response, the Blackwood initiator may ask for the queen of trump
(or extra trump length) by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement) - 4NT - 5♣ - 5♦ = Queen ask
      * 5♥ = no queen
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦ = queen, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 5NT = queen, no kings

#### With (Useful) Voids
After 4NT, responder can show voids with at least one keycard:
   * 5NT = even number of keycards (never zero)
   * 6 of void suit = odd number of keycards
   * 6 of trump suit = odd number of keycards, void is in higher suit

#### 5NT
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.

### Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over any 1NT OR 2NT by partner, including a rebid of
1NT OR 2NT. Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦: 0 aces
   * 4♥: 1 ace
   * 4♠: 2 aces
   * 4NT: 3 aces

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦: 0 or 4 kings
   * 5♥: 1 king
   * 5♠: 2 kings
   * 5NT: 3 kings

### 5NT Pick a Slam
A voluntary bid of 5NT is forcing and asks partner to try to pick the best slam available.
There are no hard-and-fast rules here, but possibilities include:
   * bidding a new 4-card suit (looking for a 4-4 fit)
   * supporting partner with mild support (looking for a good 7-card fit)
   * rebidding a previously bid suit with unannounced length and/or strength
   * returning to 6NT with no better options

The asker may continue to bid up the line if completely displeased with the response.

### Quantitative 4NT
When suit agreement has not been reached, a bid of 4NT is quantitative (slam invitational).
There are a number of ways to accept the invitation.

4NT quantitative:
   * 5♣: 0 or 4 aces
   * 5♦: 1 ace
   * 5♥: 2 aces
   * 5♠: 3 aces
   * 5NT: pick a slam
   * any 6-bid: suggested place to play (pass or correct)

### Grand Slam Force
A jump to 5NT (and some 5NT bids when the auction is at the five level) is “Grand
Slam Force,” asking partner to bid a grand slam with two of the three top trump
honors:

5NT
   * 6 of the trump suit = fewer than two top trump honors (A, K, or Q).
   * 7 of the trump suit = two of the three top trump honors.

### Voluntary 5-bid
A voluntary bid of 5 of a suit is invitational to slam.
It is used in two circumstances: 
   * If opponents have bid one suit or there is one unbid suit, it asks for second-round control in that suit. Responder:
      * Bids 5NT with an unguarded K to invite an alternative contract of 6NT
	  * Raises to 6 with first or second-round control
	  * Passes otherwise
   * Otherwise, it asks for top trump honors. Responder 
      * Raises to 7 with AK and the Q or extra length
	  * Raises to 6 with at least AJ or KQ
	  * Passes otherwise

### Forcing 3NT
Once agreement in a major suit has been reached, 
a bid of 3NT is a slam try that asks responder to cue bid first-round controls.
A voluntary cue bid at the 4-level that skips 3NT is also a slam try. 
The two bids say nothing specific about hand strength 
but are more tactical in nature.
For example, the player that will be declarer may choose to bid 3NT 
so as to not reveal any unnecessary information about the closed hand.

## Defensive Bidding 
### Doubles
A double is for takeout over a partscore bid (4♦ or lower). 
In the direct position over a 1-level bid, it shows about 13+ total points and support for the unbid suits or 18+ points and any distribution. 
In the balancing position it can be 2-3 points lighter.

Advancer is expected to bid after a takeout double. 
The Rule of 9 (#cards + #honors + bid level >= 9) is a reasonable guideline to determine when to convert the double to penalty.
With insufficient strength and no compelling suit, a 1NT bid is permissible. 
Unlike in other bidding situations, bid four-card suits highest first. 
In some cases this will allow you to show your second suit and give partner a choice of places to play. 

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational (9-12 declarer points). 
To force for one round, responder cuebids opener’s suit. 
This is forcing to game by an unpassed hand.

Any subsequent bid by doubler shows significant extras and is strongly invitational to game. 
If advancer has jumped, then a new suit or NT bid by doubler is forcing to game.

Over opening game bids (4♥ or higher), a double is for penalty.
However, advancer may pull the double with undisclosed distribution and/or poor defensive values.
### Responsive Doubles
After an opponent bids at the one level, partner doubles for takeout,
and the other opponent raises, a double by advancer is responsive. 
This allows the original doubler to be declarer and to pick the preferred suit.

Responsive Doubles are on through 4♦ but off after a preemptive opening.
### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 7–16 points nonvulnerable and 9-16 points vulnerable
(double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
In general an overcall shows 5+ cards 
but it may show a strong 4 (AKJx) at the one level.

The one exception is over 1♣ where an overcall of 1♦ does little to obstruct the opponents.
(1♣)
   * 1♦: a good 4 or bad 5, often lead-directing
   * 2♦: sound overcall (would bid over 1♠)
   
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.

Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural.

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠: a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣: a hand that would open 3♣.

When the opponents have bid two suits,
an overcall in either suit is natural.

#### Responses
Raises are natural and generally preemptive.
A new suit by an unpassed hand is forcing. 
By a passed hand, a new suit is non-forcing but constructive.

A cuebid of opener’s suit shows good support (limit raise or better).

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦:
   * (Pass) — 2♠: minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other: natural, game-forcing.

### NT Overcalls
With appropriate strength and a stopper in the opponent's suit,
you may make a NT overcall.
All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

#### Direct Position (1X-?)
   * 10-14 HCP: pass or double then pass
   * 15-18 HCP: 1NT
   * 19-21 HCP: double then bid NT
   * 22-24 HCP: double then jump NT
   
#### Balancing Position (1X-p-p-?)
   * 10-14 HCP: pass or 1NT
   * 15-18 HCP: double then 1NT
   * 19-21 HCP: 2NT
   * 22-24 HCP: 3NT

#### 2-Level (2X-? or 1X-p-2X-?)
   * 15-18 HCP: 2NT
   * 19-21 HCP: 3NT
   * 22-24 HCP: double then 3NT
      
#### 3-Level (3X-? or any-p-3X-?)
   * bad 16 HCP or less: pass
   * good 16+ HCP: 3NT

### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
(It may show 4-5-2-2 distribution but in that case it should be a king stronger.)

(1♦) - 2NT = hearts and clubs

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.

Note: Unusual 2NT may be off in the reopening seat (see NT Overcalls above).

### Unusual 4NT
In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Over an opening 4♠ bid, 4NT is takeout.
### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

   * If the opening is in a minor suit, the cuebid shows the majors; 
   * If the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.
When vulnerable, it is best to avoid very weak hands. 
(This also makes it easier for advancer to decide to bid game.)
When non-vulnerable, the low-end range is much wider. 

#### Responses to a Minor Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
1. 2NT: Invitational
1. Opponent's suit: Game or slam try

#### Responses to a Major Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
2. Jump in major: Weak if below game
1. 2NT: asks for overcaller’s minor.
   * If advancer then returns to the major, this is invitational.
   * If there is further interference, 4NT may also ask for the minor.

#### Rare Responses to Either Cuebid

2. Jump in major: Good support, but weak if below game
1. Unbid minor (no further interference): Weak
1. 3NT: To play

#### Overcaller Rebids
Overcaller will normally have a weak hand and will pass or make a minimum response. 
With a strong hand or freakier distribution, overcaller will make some other bid.
### Landy vs 1NT
#### Unpassed Hand
Landy is a simple defense to 1NT with only one artificial bid:
   * Double: Penalty
   * 2♣: Majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
   * 2NT: Minors
   * Others: Natural

After 2♣, advancer generally bids the better major.
   * pass: No major, long clubs
   * 2♦: No preference
   * 2♥, 2♠: Weak, sign-off
   * 2NT: Forcing, invitational in either major
   * 3♥, 3♠: Limit raise
   * 4♥, 4♠: To play

#### Passed Hand
Since it is impossible to have a penalty double as a passed hand,
double is a relay to 2♣.
### Defense of Strong Openings
Against any strong opening (usually 2♣ or 1♣), 
the defense against a strong 1NT is used.
A double of 2♣ is the equivalent of a direct 2♣ bid in the NT system.
## Preemptive Bids
Opening major suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and 
may be very weak particularly in first seat. 
In a major they typically show seven cards. 
In a minor (particularly clubs) the rules are less strict especially in Matchpoints and/or non-vulnerable. 
   
Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:
   * more than one outside trick
   * a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better
   * a void in a minor

Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.

Raises are best used with an unbalanced hand and decent trump support.
## Competitive Bidding 
It is sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠943 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣Q3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

### New Suits
In a competitive sequence, new suits by an unpassed hand are forcing.
(To make a constructive, non-forcing bid, consider a Negative Double.)
New suits by a passed hand are constructive but non-forcing.

Jump shifts are weak, showing a similar hand to a preempt.

### Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows a limit raise or better:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = limit raise or better.

Note: If playing inverted minors ON in competition, then that treatment supercedes this one.

### Jump Raise
When using this treatment, a jump raise is weak / competitive.

1♠ - (2♣) - 3♠ = weak, 4+ card support

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+  

### With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

#### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (11-12 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

### Against Conventions
After partner opens in a suit and a conventional bid by the opponents shows one known suit, 
a cue bid shows a good raise, a double shows a good hand without support, and other bids are weak. 
For example:

1♠ — (2♠:Michaels) 
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: weak
   * 3♥: Limit raise or better in spades.
   * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

If the conventional bid shows two known suits, 
there are two cue bids available, the first shows the fourth suit and the second shows good support. 
For example:

1♣ — (2NT:Unusual) 
   * 3♣, 3♠: weak
   * 3♦: 10+HCP, 5+ spades
   * 3♥: Limit raise or better in clubs.
   * Double: at least 10 points, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

### Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double, bid as naturally as possible.

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 1NT = non-forcing, 6-9 points, no four-card major or four-card support
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, could have good support.
   * 2♦ = weak, four-card trump support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

1♥ — (Double)
   * 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 1NT = non-forcing, 6-9 points.
   * 2♣, 2♦ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, could have a limit raise.
   * 2♥ = weak, generally three-card support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 2NT = game force (Jacoby)
   * 3♥ = weak, generally four-card support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 4♥ = natural, could be preemptive

### Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major. 
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level. 
With insufficient high-card strength for a free bid, double may also be used with a five-card or longer suit.

   * 1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.
   * 1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).
   * 1♦ — (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–6 points.
   * 1♠ — (4♦) — Double = four hearts and 10+ points or five hearts and 8-10 points.

If both majors are bid, then a double shows both minors.
   * 1♥ — (1♠) — Double = 4-4 or better in the minors.

When the opponents overcall a minor over a minor at the two-level or higher, 
a double shows at least one four-card major 
and at least two places to play.

   * 1♦ — (2♣) — Double = at least one four-card major.
   * 1♣ — (2♦) — Double = at least one four-card major.

If opener bids the a major you cannot support, 
rebid opener's first suit or NT to imply the other major.

### Card-Showing Doubles
In a competitive auction below game, a double is card-showing. 
Partner is requested to do something intelligent, such as:
  * Show secondary support for a previously bid suit
  * Rebid an extra-long or extra-strong suit
  * Bid a previously unbid four-card suit
  * Bid NT with at least one good stopper
  * Convert to penalty (usually with a decent four cards)

### Penalty Doubles
A double is unequivocally for penalty in the following cases:
  * After a game contract by the opponents
  * After a natural NT bid by any player
  * After a pass
  * After two previous doubles by either partner
  * After partner has bid or doubled over an opposing preempt and preempter's partner has raised

#### Lightner Doubles
A double of a NT or slam contract is Lightner, asking for a specific lead such as:
  * dummy's first bid suit
  * a suit doubler has not shown

#### Lead-Directing Doubles
In fourth position or after a pass, double of an artificial bid is lead-directing. 
To make the bid, doubler must be confident that:
   * the lead will be helpful
   * the opponents will not be able to make the contract redoubled

### Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;
   * the opponents make a penalty double of 1NT and partner passes:
      * 1NT — (Double) — pass — (pass) — Redouble = Penalty, responder passes or scrambles;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.

## Defensive Leads and Signals 
#### Carding
First discard is attitude for that suit. (See "Signals" below.)
#### Signals (Upside-Down Count and Attitude)
   1. Attitude (low encourages)
   1. Count (low = even)
   1. Suit preference (high = higher suit)

A jack is an encouraging card, more than a 2.
#### Leads
Leads are: 
* top of touching honors and interior sequences.
* A from A–K–x-(x...)
   * Q from partner either is singleton or promises J
* K from A-K tight or A-K-J-(x)
* Q from A-K-Q-x-(x...) - requests count
* Top of all doubletons (including honors)
* 2nd best from x-x-x-x or x-x-x-x-x (show original 4th best at next opportunity)
* 4th best from H-x-x-x or H-x-x-x-x
* Bottom from H-x-x, top from x–x–x (BOSTON)

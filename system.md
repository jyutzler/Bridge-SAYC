
This branch contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes the bridge system
used by Jeff Yutzler and Donna Hickling. 
It is based on SAYC with a few additions.
It is suitable for intermediate club players.

## General Approach 
Two-over-one game forcing with five-card majors

Strong forcing opening: 2♣;
## Balanced Openings 
Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is particularly strong. 
Semi-balanced hands with either 5-4-2-2 or 6-3-2-2 distribution 
may be treated as balanced if the doubletons are Qx or better. 

A hand may be upgraded 1 point for a long suit with good texture (e.g., QJT9x)
and downgraded 1 point for a 4-3-3-3 hand with poor texture (e.g., AJx-KJx-Axx-Qxxx).

The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:

   * 12-14: Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT
   * 15-17: Open 1NT
   * 18-19: Open 1 of a suit, jump NT
   * 20-21: Open 2NT
   * 22-24: Open 2♣, rebid NT
   * 25-27: Open 3NT
   * 28+: Open 2♣, jump NT

### 1NT 15-17 
#### Basic Responses
2NT = Invitational 8-9

3NT = sign-off

#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit.

Opener rebids:

   * 2♦ with no four-card major 
   * 2♥ with four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠ with four spades or five spades and four hearts

Responder will generally invite or bid game. 
If responder rebids three of either minor,
he shows slam interest and at least a five-card suit.
A rebid of 4NT over a major is Blackwood so if you want to make a quantitative raise, 
you must bid a minor first.
#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major. 
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):

   * 2♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 2♥ = transfer to spades. 

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level 
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, 
that is natural and game forcing. 
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠

   * Pass = content to play 2♠.
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3♠
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥ = natural and game forcing (4+).
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠.
   * 4NT = quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit.
   * 5NT = asking for a choice between 6♠ and 6NT.

#### Single-suited Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major. 
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):

   * 4♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 4♥ = transfer to spades 

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer, 
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands 
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents. 
The following shows how they are used with strong NT (15-17) openings.

   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Game invitation (would make a 1/1 bid): Jacoby, raise (Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.)
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Jacoby, raise to 4 in suit
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Texas, 4NT (Blackwood)
   * Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors): Texas, 5NT

It is rare, but a direct bid of 4♠ or 6♠ is to play and is only used when your hand is not amenable to transferring.
#### 5-5 Majors
When using the Jacoby transfer, it is possible to show 5-5 in the majors 
with a number of hand types.

   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass = bust
   * 1NT - 2♦ - 2♥ - 2♠ = invitational
   * 1NT - 2♥ - 2♠ - 3♥ = game forcing

#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor.

   * 2♠ = transfer to clubs
   * 3♣ = transfer to diamonds

Opener accepts the transfer unless game is reachable opposite nothing more than Qxxxxx.

A 2NT response to 2♠ is a preacceptance which shows good support for clubs.

#### Other Responses
   * 3♥, 3♠ = at least a six-card suit and slam interest (otherwise,
responder uses a transfer bid).
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

#### When Opponents Double
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

1NT — (Double) — 2♣ = Stayman

1NT — (Double) — 2♦ = transfer to hearts

With a bad hand and a long minor, redouble for SOS.

1NT — (Double) — Redouble = Rescue - weak with a long minor (opener bids 2♣, pass or correct).

Otherwise pass and let opener reopen the bidding.

1NT — (Double) — pass - (pass) = Forcing - opener must either bids a 5-card suit or redoubles. 
Responder passes the redouble with 7+ (possibly less) 
or bids a 4-card suit to attempt to scramble to safety.
#### Over 2♣
Jacoby Transfers are on over 2♣.

Double of an artificial 2♣ = Stayman, does not imply invitational or better values. 

#### Over Other Overcalls
Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents is for penalty.

Cue bid of opponent's natural suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

Suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.

   * 2♥, 2♠ = To play, 5+.
   * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.

#### Interference With Conventions
If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥ = Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts

The Texas transfer is on through 3♣. In other words it must be a jump.

### 2NT and 3NT 
Stayman and Jacoby transfers for the majors are used.

#### 2NT 20-21
   * 3♣ = Stayman.
   * 3♦, 3♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively.
   * 4♣ = Gerber (ace asking).
   * 4NT = Invites a slam in notrump.

#### 3NT 25-27
   * 4♣ = Stayman.
   * 4♦, 4♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively

#### 4NT Blackwood Opening
An opening of 4NT shows a rare hand that is solid except for aces or kings.
Standard Blackwood responses are used.
## Major Openings 
Normally open five-card majors in all seats.

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.
### NT Responses 
#### 1NT Forcing
1NT typically shows 6–12 points and is used in a number of circumstances:
   * No support for the major opened 
   * A three-card limit raise
   * A bust hand with otherwise good trump support (too weak for a direct raise)

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

It is 100% forcing so responder must be prepared for a three-card response or a rebid with only five cards.

### Raises 
#### Basic Raises
   * 2 = three-card or longer heart support; 7–10 dummy points (strong enough to accept at least one game try).
   * 3 = four-card limit raise (11–12 dummy points).
   * 4 = usually five+ cards, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

#### Jacoby 2NT
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening:

   * 2NT = Game-forcing raise (13+ dummy points, 4+ trumps, all hand patterns). 
Asks opener to describe his hand to help responder evaluate slam prospects.

      * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠ = singleton or void in that suit.
      * 4♥ = minimum hand.
      * 3NT = medium hand (15–17).
      * 3♥ = maximum hand (18+).
	  * 4♣, 4♦, 4♠ = 5-card suit with two of the top three honors.

This treatment is also on after a takeout double but is off as a passed hand (see below).
	  
#### 3NT
3NT = 13-15 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

#### 2NT (passed hand only)
2NT = 11-12 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

#### Splinter Raises
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening, a double jump shows 13+ dummy points,
4+ card support, and shortness in the suit bid (either a singleton or void).
Opener can explore slam by bidding controls or attempt to sign off by bidding game.
For example:

1♠ — 4♣ = game forcing, club shortness

   * 4♦, 4♥ = slam interest, first round control (usually ace)
   * 4♠ = signoff

Responder shows a void by rebidding the splinter suit:

1♠ — 4♣ 

4♥ — 5♣ = void

Opener can also splinter with a good hand and 4-card support:

1♣ — 1♠

   * 4♦, 4♥ = game forcing, shortness

In competition, splinters are off except for jumps in the opponent's suit.

Note: This is the treatment recommended by Richard Pavlicek as described in this [quiz](http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/quiz.pl?5h4100).

#### Two Way Reverse Drury
In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall). 
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following: 
   * 2 of a minor shows a limit raise
      * 2♣ = 3 card support
      * 2♦ = 4+ card support
   * Opener clarifies strength with the rebid   
      * Rebidding the suit at the 2 level shows a light opener
      * any other bid shows a full opener

## Minor Openings 
﻿A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4–4–3–2 shape: 
four spades, four hearts, three diamonds, and two clubs, which should
be opened 1♦.

## One Over One 
A 1/1 bid shows 6+ dummy points and either a 5+ card suit or no lower 4-card suit.

A diamond suit is routinely skipped if it is not particularly long or strong.

### Opener Rebids 
Opener’s rebids are natural and standard.

#### Rebids with a minimum hand (13–16 points)
   * Rebidding notrump at the lowest available level;
   * Raising responder’s suit at the lowest level (usually four cards, though good three-card support is acceptable if notrump is not);
   * Rebidding a new suit at the one level or rebidding a new suit at the two level that
is lower ranking than the opening suit (not reversing);
   * Rebidding opener’s suit at the lowest level.

#### Rebids with a medium hand (17–18 points)
   * Jump raise or jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Reverse in a new suit, i.e., bid a new suit at the two level which is higher ranking
than the opening suit;
   * Non-reverse bid in a new suit (this has the wide range of 13–18 points)

#### With a maximum hand (19–21 or 22 points) opener must make a very strong rebid:
   * Jump in notrump;
   * Double jump raise of responder’s suit or double jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Jump shift in a new suit.

Responder follows up by attempting to sign off in game, bidding 4NT
Blackwood, or cuebidding if still interested in trying to cooperate with opener
in making the slam decision.

### Responder Rebids 
If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

#### Sign-off
Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

1♥ — 1♠

2♣

   * Pass
   * 2♥ = 2-3 hearts, likely misfit
   * 2♠ = 6+ spades

There is one exception to the rule that new suits are forcing:

1♣ — 1♠

1NT

   * 2♥ = sign-off - opener must pass or correct (bust with 5-5 or 5-4 distribution)
   
#### Inviting Game
Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, 3 of opener's suit, new minor, fourth suit:

1♥ — 1♠

2♦ — 2NT, 3♦, 3♥ = 11–12 points, inviting game.

In addition, a new minor suit at the responder's second bid or later is forcing for one round and thus
is invitational at the 2-level and game forcing at the 3-level.

1♥ — 1♠

1NT (or 2♣) — 2♦ (forcing)

In this case, opener is encouraged to show secondary support for responder's suit. 
When more than one minor is available, it tends to show a stopper for NT.

#### Forcing to Game
All second round jumps (except for opener's suit as mentioned above) 
are forcing to 3NT or higher: 

1♥ — 1♠

1NT or 2m

   * 3♥ = game forcing (5-5 or 5-4 distribution)
   * 3♠ = game forcing (6+ cards)

Opener can sign off in game or make a slam try. 
4NT is Blackwood (see topic) only if suit agreement has been established. 
Otherwise it is quantitative, asking responder to proceed with a maximum. 
Suit bids usually show controls.

#### Signing off at Game
Any bid of game is a sign-off, though partner can proceed with a maximum (see Slam Bidding).

## Two Over One 
By an unpassed hand, a two-over-one response shows 13+ points and 4+ cards 
or exactly 3 of opener's major. 
It is forcing to game.

2♥ over 1♠ shows 5+ cards.

2♣ over 1♦ shows 5+ cards and does not deny a 4-card major.

#### Opener's Rebids
Opener responds naturally to clarify the hand.

   * 2NT - balanced minimum and suitable for declaring NT
   * 3NT - balanced maximum
   * Any other suit - 4+ cards (reverse implies extra strength)
   * Jump shift - splinter support of previously bid suit
   * Rebid of original suit - no better response

## Game Tries 
#### Help Suit Game Try

Once suit agreement has been reached in a non-game-forcing auction, a new suit is a game try.
The idea is to identify a suit Qxx or better that would benefit from fitting honors. One may bid game, sign off, or make another game try.
## Strong 2♣ 
﻿A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points balanced, 8 1/2+ tricks in a major, or 9 1/2+ tricks in a minor. 

Responses:

2♣ 
   * 2♦= conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response.
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦= natural and game forcing with a minimum of 8 HCP and 
a five-card suit with two of the top three honors.
   * 2NT = 8+ HCP, balanced.

After a 2♦ response, opener rebids naturally:
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦ = natural, forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor
   * 2NT = 22-24 points (see responses for 2NT opening above)
   * 3NT = 28+ points (see responses for 3NT opening above)

In response to a suit rebid, responder indicates strength.

2♣ — 2♦

2♥ 
   * 2♠, 3♦ = natural, game force
   * 3♣ = artificial, very weak (0-4, not an ace)
   * 3NT = 5-7 points, at best a low doubleton
   * 3♥ = positive, slam invitational
   * 4♥ = sign-off
   
## Weak Two Bids of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ 
A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. On rare
occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. It is possible to open a weak two with
a poor seven-card suit (not good enough to open with at the three level). 

Responses:

A 2NT response is forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) Opener rebids his suit with a
minimum weak two (5–8 points). With a maximum hand opener bids another
suit to show a “feature” (ace or king in that suit); 
with a solid suit (AKJxxx or better) he raises to 3NT.

Any raise of opener’s suit is to play and could be preemptive. 

A 3NT response is also to play.

“RONF” on the card means “Raise Only Non-Force.” A new-suit response is forcing
one round and shows at least a five-card suit. Opener should raise a major suit
response with a three-card fit, or perhaps with a doubleton honor.

With no fit for responder’s suit, opener rebids:
   * With a minimum weak two-bid (5–8 points), rebid the suit at the lowest level.
   * With a maximum weak two-bid, name a new suit or bid notrump.
   
## Slam Bidding 
### Roman Key-Card Blackwood 1430
Once suit agreement has been reached, 4NT is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump. 

4NT KC Asking:
   * 5♣ = 1 or 4 keycards
   * 5♦ = 3 or 0 keycards
   * 5♥ = 2 keycards, no queen of trump
   * 5♠ = 2 keycards, queen of trump

After a 5♣ or 5♦ response, the Blackwood initiator may ask for the queen of trump
(or extra trump length) by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement) - 4NT - 5♣ - 5♦ = Queen ask
      * 5♥ = no queen
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦ = queen, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 5NT = queen, no kings
	  * 6♥ = queen, ♠K


#### With (Useful) Voids
After 4NT, responder can show voids with at least one keycard:
   * 5NT = even number of keycards (never zero)
   * 6 of void suit = odd number of keycards
   * 6 of trump suit = odd number of keycards, void is in higher suit

#### 5NT
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.



### Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over any 1NT OR 2NT by partner, including a rebid of
1NT OR 2NT. Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦ = 0 aces
   * 4♥ = 1 ace
   * 4♠ = 2 aces
   * 4NT = 3 aces

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦ = 0 or 4 kings
   * 5♥ = 1 king
   * 5♠ = 2 kings
   * 5NT = 3 kings

### 5NT Pick a Slam
A voluntary bid of 5NT is forcing and asks partner to try to pick the best slam available.
There are no hard-and-fast rules here, but possibilities include:
   * bidding a new 4-card suit (looking for a 4-4 fit)
   * supporting partner with mild support (looking for a good 7-card fit)
   * rebidding a previously bid suit with unannounced length and/or strength
   * returning to 6NT with no better options

The asker may continue to bid up the line if completely displeased with the response.

### Grand Slam Force
A jump to 5NT (and some 5NT bids when the auction is at the five level) is “Grand
Slam Force,” asking partner to bid a grand slam with two of the three top trump
honors:

5NT
   * 6 of the trump suit = fewer than two top trump honors (A, K, or Q).
   * 7 of the trump suit = two of the three top trump honors.

## Defensive Bidding 
### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 8–16 points nonvulnerable and 10-16 points vulnerable
(double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
In general an overcall shows 5+ cards 
but it may show a strong 4 (AKJx) at the one level.
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural.

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

The one exception is over 1♣ where an overcall of 1♦ does little to obstruct the opponents.
(1♣)
   * 1♦ = a good 4, often lead-directing
   * 2♦ = sound overcall (would bid over 1♠)
   
When the opponents have bid two suits,
an overcall in either suit is natural.

### NT Overcalls
#### Direct
A 1NT overcall shows 15–18 points and a balanced hand (preferably a stopper in
opener’s suit). All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 19-21 points.

#### Reopening
A reopening 1NT after an opponent has opened shows 10–14 points. 
This is a wide range, but there will not usually be a game on for you.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 15-18 points 
or jump to 2NT to show 19-21.

#### Vs. Preempts
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in notrump is natural.
### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
(It may show 4-5-2-2 distribution but in that case it should be a king stronger.)

(1♦) - 2NT = hearts and clubs

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.

In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Note: Unusual 2NT is off in the reopening seat (see above).
### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

If the opening is in a minor suit,
the cuebid shows the majors; if the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

(1♦) — 2♦ = at least 5–5 in the majors.

(1♠) — 2♠ = at least 5–5 in hearts and a minor.

Responder can bid 2NT over a major suit cuebid to ask for partner’s minor.

(1♥) — 2♥ — (Pass) — 2NT (asks for the minor).
   * 3♣ = club suit.
   * 3♦ = diamond suit.

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.
### Doubles
A double is for takeout over an opening partscore bid (4♦ or lower); penalty over
opening game bids (4♥ or higher). 
However, advancer may pull the double with undisclosed length and/or poor defensive values.

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational. 
To force, responder cuebids opener’s suit.
## Preemptive Bids
Opening major suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and based on playing tricks
(the number of tricks you expect to take if your long suit is trumps).
Overbid based on the rule of 2-3-4:
   * vulnerable vs. nonvulnerable: overbid by 2 tricks
   * equal vulnerability: overbid by 3 tricks
   * nonvulnerable vs. vulnerable: overbid by 4 tricks

In a minor, preempts are less predictable so be cautious about raising 
with a balanced hand.
   
Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:
   * more than one outside trick
   * a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better
   * a void in a minor

Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.
### Landy
#### Unpassed Hand
Landy is a simple defense to 1NT with only one artificial bid:
   * Double: Penalty
   * 2♣: Majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
   * 2NT: Minors
   * Others: Natural

After 2♣, advancer bids the better major or 2♦ to defer to partner.

#### Passed Hand
Since it is impossible to have a penalty double as a passed hand,
double is a relay to 2♣.
## Competitive Bidding 
It is sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠J43 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣J3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

### New Suits
In a competitive sequence, new suits by an unpassed hand are forcing.
(To make a constructive, non-forcing bid, consider a Negative Double.)
New suits by a passed hand are constructive but non-forcing.

Jump shifts are weak, showing a similar hand to a preempt.

### Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows a limit raise or better:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = limit raise or better.

Note: If playing inverted minors ON in competition, then that treatment supercedes this one.

### Jump Raise
When using this treatment, a jump raise is weak / competitive.

1♠ - (2♣) - 3♠ = weak, 4+ card support

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+  

### With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

#### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (12–14 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

### Against Conventions
If the opponents use a convention (such as Michaels or the unusual notrump), you
can double to show at least 10 points, or you can cuebid their lowest shown suit
to show a good raise.

1♠ — (2♠) 
   * 3♥ = Limit raise or better.
   * Double = at least 10 points, probably balanced.

### Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major. 
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level. 
With insufficient points, double may also be used with a five-card suit.

   * 1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.
   * 1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).
   * 1♦ — (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–6 points.
   * 1♠ — (4♦) — Double = four hearts and 10+ points or five hearts and 8-10 points.

If both majors are bid, then a double shows both minors.
   * 1♥ — (1♠) — Double = 4-4 or better in the minors.

When the opponents overcall a minor over a minor at the two-level or higher, 
a double shows at least one four-card major.

   * 1♦ — (2♣) — Double = at least one four-card major.
   * 1♣ — (2♦) — Double = at least one four-card major.

If opener bids the a major you cannot support, 
rebid opener's first suit or NT to imply the other major.

### Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double, bid as naturally as possible.

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 1NT = non-forcing, 6-9 points, no four-card major or four-card support
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, could have good support.
   * 2♦ = weak, four-card trump support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

1♥ — (Double)
   * 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 1NT = non-forcing, 6-9 points.
   * 2♣, 2♦ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, could have a limit raise.
   * 2♥ = weak, generally three-card support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 2NT = game force (Jacoby)
   * 3♥ = weak, generally four-card support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 4♥ = natural, could be preemptive

### Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;
   * the opponents make a penalty double of 1NT and partner passes:
      * 1NT — (Double) — pass — (pass) — Redouble = Penalty, responder passes or scrambles;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.

## Defensive Leads and Signals 
Signals are:
   1. Attitude (high encourages)
   1. Count (high = even)
   1. Suit preference (high = higher suit)

First discard against NT is Lavinthal. 
A high card encourages the higher ranking suit, 
low encourages the lower ranking suit.

Leads are: 
   * top of touching honors and interior sequences.
   * A from A–K–x
   * 4th best from x-x-x-x or x-x-x-x-x. 
   * Top from x–x–x.

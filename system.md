in this case Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) as described at 
http://www.acbl.org/documentlibrary/play/SP3%20(bk)%20single%20pages.pdf.

# General Approach 
Standard American with 5 Card Majors

Strong forcing opening: 2♣;
# Notrump Opening Bids 
Notrump openings show a balanced hand. It is permissible to have a five-card major suit provided the hand is otherwise suitable for notrump.
## 1NT 15-17 
### Basic Responses
2NT = Invitational 8-9

3NT = sign-off

### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit.

Opener rebids:
   * 2♦ with no four-card major 
   * 2♥ with four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠ with four spades or five spades and four hearts


If responder rebids three of either minor,
he shows slam interest and at least a five-card suit.
### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby transfer that shows a five-card suit is used for the majors: 2♦ is a
transfer to hearts, 2♥ is a transfer to spades. Opener accepts the transfer, though
he can jump to the three level with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s
major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, that is natural and
game forcing. Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠
   * Pass = content to play 2♠.
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3♠
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♠ = invitational with a six-card suit. Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥ = natural and game forcing.
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠.
   * 4♠ = placing the contract, with a six-card or longer suit.

### 2 Spades
A 2♠ response requires the 1NT bidder to rebid 3♣, which may be passed with a
club bust, or responder may rebid 3♦ with a diamond bust. Example:

1NT — 2♠ — 3♣ 
   * Pass = club bust
   * 3♦ = diamond bust (notrump opener passes).

### Other Responses
   * 3♣, 3♦ = a six-card or longer suit and invitational to 3NT.
   * 3♥, 3♠ = at least a six-card suit and slam interest (otherwise,
responder uses a transfer bid).
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

### Over Interference
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

1NT — (Double) — 2♣ = Stayman

1NT — (Double) — 2♦ = transfer to hearts

If an opponent bids over your 1NT opener, conventional responses like Stayman
and transfers are “off.” Bids are natural except for a cuebid, which can be used with
game forcing strength as a substitute for Stayman.

If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥ = Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts
## 2NT and 3NT 
Stayman and Jacoby transfers for the majors are used.

### 2NT 20-21
   * 3♣ = Stayman.
   * 3♦, 3♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively.
   * 4♣ = Gerber (ace asking).
   * 4NT = Invites a slam in notrump.

### 3NT 25-27
   * 4♣ = Stayman.
   * 4♦, 4♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively

# Major Openings 
Normally open five-card majors in all seats.

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6
## Basic Responses Over 1♥
   * 1♠ = at least four spades, 6 or more points. Tends to deny a heart fit.
   * 2♣, 2♦ = 11 points or more, promises at least four of the suit.
   * 2♥ = three-card or longer heart support; 6–10 dummy points.
   * 2♠, 3♣, 3♦ = strong jump shifts. Invites a slam.
   * 3♥ = limit raise (10–12 dummy points with three or more hearts).
   * 3NT = 15–17 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.
   * 4♥ = usually five+ hearts, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

## Basic Responses Over 1♠
Same as above except:
   * 2♥ = 11 points or more, promises at least five of the suit.

## 1NT Response
1NT shows 6–10 points and denies support for the major opened.

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

It is not forcing, but opener is expected to bid unless the hand is a minimum
with one of the following hand patterns:
   * 5-3-3-2 
   * 4=5=2=2 distribution (four spades and five hearts)

## Jacoby 2NT
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening
   * 2NT = Game-forcing raise (Jacoby 2NT), 13+ dummy points. Asks
opener to show a short suit to help responder evaluate slam prospects.
If opener has no short suit, he shows his hand strength;
      * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠ = singleton or void in that suit. Other bids deny a short suit.
      * 4♥ = minimum hand.
      * 3NT = medium hand (15–17).
      * 3♥ = maximum hand (18+)

## Rebids by Opener 
Opener’s rebids are natural and standard.
### Rebids with a minimum hand (13–16 points)
   * Rebidding notrump at the lowest available level;
   * Raising responder’s suit at the lowest level (may have good three-card support);
   * Rebidding a new suit at the one level or rebidding a new suit at the two level that
is lower ranking than the opening suit (not reversing);
   * Rebidding opener’s suit at the lowest level.

### Rebids with a medium hand (17–18 points)
   * Jump raise or jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Reverse in a new suit, i.e., bid a new suit at the two level which is higher ranking
than the opening suit;
   * Non-reverse bid in a new suit (this has the wide range of 13–18 points)

### With a maximum hand (19–21 or 22 points) opener must make a very strong rebid:
   * Jump in notrump;
   * Double jump raise of responder’s suit or double jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Jump shift in a new suit.

Responder follows up by attempting to sign off in game, bidding 4NT
Blackwood, or cuebidding if still interested in trying to cooperate with opener
in making the slam decision.

# Minor Openings 
﻿A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4–4–3–2 shape: 
four spades, four hearts, three diamonds, and two clubs, which should
be opened 1♦.

Responses and later bidding generally follow the ideas set down in the previous
section. Bidding at the one level is up-the-line in principle. Responder needs more
trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣, though one fewer trump will do
in a pinch in a competitive sequence). 

Responses of 2NT and 3NT are standard:

1♣
   * 2NT = 13–15, game forcing
   * 3NT = 16–17

There is no forcing minor-suit raise.

## Subsequent Bidding by Responder 
If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.


Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

1♥ — 1♠

2♣ — Pass, 2♥, 2♠ = 6–10 points, sign-off in partscore.

Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, 3 of a previously bid suit:

1♥ — 1♠

2♦ — 2NT, 3♦, 3♥, 3♠ = 11–12 points, inviting game.

After opener rebids in a suit, a new suit by responder is forcing. If the new suit is the
fourth suit, the bid may be artificial/conventional.

1♥ — 1♠

2♣ — 2♦ = one-round force, could be conventional.

However, after a 1NT rebid by opener, bids of a new suit at the next higher level are
non-forcing.

1♥ — 1♠

1NT — 2♣, 2♦ = non-forcing. Responder must jump shift to 3♣ or 3♦ to force game.
Second-round forcing bids following a 1NT rebid by opener: a reverse or jump shift
into a new suit is a game force.

1♣ — 1♥

1NT — 2♠ or 3♦ = game force.

Bids available for signing off in game.

3NT, 4♥, 4♠, 5♣, 5♦.

If responder initially bids a new suit at the two level, the same rules apply EXCEPT
that a subsequent jump raise of opener’s first suit to the THREE LEVEL is game
forcing — responder should make a limit raise directly over the opening with 10–12
points and at least three-card support:

1♠ — 2♣

2♥ — 2NT, 3♣, 3♥ = Invitation to game (11–12 points).

— 2♠ = preference, not forcing. Responder has 11–12 points and a
 doubleton spade.

 — 3♦ = game force, could be conventional.

 — 3♠ = game force.5

NOTE: Responder promises to bid again if he responded with a new suit at the two
level unless opener’s rebid is at the game level.

1♠ — 2♣

2♦ = forcing one round. Responder can limit his hand by bidding 2♠, 2NT, 3♣,
or 3♦ at this point. He should not pass, since opener could have 18
points (just short of a jump shift rebid).

# Strong 2♣ 
﻿A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points, or the playing equivalent. 

Responses:

2♣ 
   * 2♦= conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response.
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦= natural and game forcing. At least a five-card suit and
8 points.
   * 2NT = a balanced 8 HCP.

If opener rebids 2NT after a 2♦ response (showing 22–24 points), the same
responses are used as over a 2NT opening (see above).

If opener rebids a suit over a 2♦ response, the bidding is forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor.

2♣ — 2♦

2♥ — 2♠

3♥ = not forcing.

# Weak Two Bids of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ 
A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. On rare
occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. It is possible to open a weak two with
a poor seven-card suit (not good enough to open with at the three level). 

Responses:

A 2NT response is forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) Opener rebids his suit with a
minimum weak two (5–8 points). With a maximum hand opener bids another
suit to show a “feature” (ace or king in that suit); lacking a feature, he raises to
3NT and lets responder place the contract.

Any raise of opener’s suit is to play and could be preemptive. 

A 3NT response is also to play.

“RONF” on the card means “Raise Only Non-Force.” A new-suit response is forcing
one round and shows at least a five-card suit. Opener should raise a major suit
response with a three-card fit, or perhaps with a doubleton honor.

With no fit for responder’s suit, opener rebids:
   * With a minimum weak two-bid (5–8 points), rebid the suit at the lowest level.
   * With a maximum weak two-bid, name a new suit or bid notrump.
   
# Slam Bidding 
## Blackwood
Blackwood 4NT is used to ask for aces. Responses show the number of aces by
steps. 5NT is then used to ask for kings; 5NT guarantees the partnership holds all
four aces.

4NT Ace Asking:
   * 5♣ = 0 or 4 aces
   * 5♦ = 1 ace
   * 5♥ = 2 aces
   * 5♠ = 3 aces

5NT King Asking:
   * 6♣ = 0 or 4 kings
   * 6♦ = 1 king
   * 6♥ = 2 kings
   * 6♠ = 3 kings

## Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over any 1NT OR 2NT by partner, including a rebid of
1NT OR 2NT. Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦ = 0 aces
   * 4♥ = 1 ace
   * 4♠ = 2 aces
   * 4NT = 3 aces

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦ = 0 or 4 kings
   * 5♥ = 1 king
   * 5♠ = 2 kings
   * 5NT = 3 kings

## Grand Slam Force
A jump to 5NT (and some 5NT bids when the auction is at the five level) is “Grand
Slam Force,” asking partner to bid a grand slam with two of the three top trump
honors:

5NT
   * 6 of the trump suit = fewer than two top trump honors (A, K, or Q).
   * 7 of the trump suit = two of the three top trump honors.

# Defensive Bidding 
## Overcalls
Overcalls show 8–16 points (double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
though it can be lighter at the minimum end.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in a suit is natural.

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid two suits is natural in either suit.

## NT Overcalls
### Direct
A 1NT overcall shows 15–18 points and a balanced hand (preferably a stopper in
opener’s suit). No conventional responses are used to the 1NT overcall except 2♣,
which is Stayman.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 19-21 points.

### Reopening
A reopening 1NT after an opponent has opened shows 10–14 points. 
This is a wide range, but there will not usually be a game on for you.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 15-18 points 
or jump to 2NT to show 19-21.

### Vs. Preempts
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in notrump is natural.
## Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
When vulnerable it shows at least opening strength
but when nonvulnerable it can be fairly light.

(1♦) - 2NT = hearts and clubs

Note: Unusual 2NT is off in the reopening seat (see above).
## Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). If the opening is in a minor suit,
the cuebid shows the majors; if the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

(1♦) — 2♦ = at least 5–5 in the majors, 8 points or more.

(1♠) — 2♠ = at least 5–5 in hearts and a minor; 10 points or more.

Responder can bid 2NT over a major suit cuebid to ask for partner’s minor.

(1♥) — 2♥ — (Pass) — 2NT (asks for the minor).
   * 3♣ = club suit.
   * 3♦ = diamond suit.

## Doubles
A double is for takeout over an opening partscore bid (4♦ or lower); penalty over
opening game bids (4♥ or higher). 

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational. 
To force, responder cuebids opener’s suit.
# Preemptive Bids
Opening suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive, usually showing 7 cards at the 3-level and 8 cards at the 4-level. They are sound, roughly in accordance with the rule of 500 - you expect to take seven tricks vulnerable, six tricks non-vulnerable out of your own hand.

# Competitive Bidding 
There is almost an endless variety of possible sequences, so it pays to have simple
guidelines to prevent bidding misunderstandings.

Bids mean the same things they meant without the intervening bid. Still, it is
sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠J43 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣J3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

## Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows values for game without clear
direction for the moment. This is often used to show a game-forcing raise:
   * 1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = game force; usually a raise.

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+  

## With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (12–14 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

## Against Conventions
If the opponents use a convention (such as Michaels or the unusual notrump), you
can double to show at least 10 points, or you can cuebid one of their shown suits
to force to game.
1♠ — (2♠) 
   * 3♥ = game force.
   * Double = at least 10 points, probably balanced.

## Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 2♠ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid
major. Bidding a major at the two level or higher shows 11 or more points and a
five-card or longer suit.

1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.

1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).

1♦— (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–10 points.
## Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double:

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * 2NT = limit raise (at least 10 points) — or better.
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, but it is better to make a more
descriptive bid of 1♥, 1♠, or 2NT with the appropriate hand.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

A responder’s jump shift after a double is to play:

1♦ — (Double) — 2♥, 2♠, 3♣ = six-plus card suit, like a weak two-bid or
preemptive three-bid.
## Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.

# Defensive Leads and Signals 
The following are specified:

Defensive signals when following suit or discarding are “high encourages, low
discourages.” Leads are top of touching honors (with choices from A–K–x and
interior sequences).

Pairs must choose from the following options.

Where no card is pre-marked in bold Italics, pairs must mark their leads.
   * Which card is led from A–K–x.
   * Which card is led from x–x–x, x–x–x–x, or x–x–x–x–x.
   * Whether 4th best, or 3rd & 5th best leads are used.
   * Whether 3rd best is led from K–J–10–x, K–10–9–x, or Q–10–9–x (and from
A–J–10–x, or A–10–9–x vs. notrump). Must be indicated by circling the card
led.
   * Whether or not frequent count signals are given.

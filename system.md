This branch contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes the bridge system
that Jeff Yutzler would use if playing with his clone. 
It is based on Standard American as taught by Richard Pavlicek at http://rpbridge.net.
It is suitable for advancing club players.

# General Approach 
Standard American with 5 Card Majors

Strong forcing opening: 2♣;
# Notrump Opening Bids 
Notrump openings show a balanced hand. It is permissible to have a five-card major suit provided the hand is otherwise suitable for notrump.
## 1NT 15-17 
### Basic Responses
   * 2♣ = Stayman (also for invitational hands)
   * 2NT = Transfer to 3♣, bust or slam invitation
   * 3♣ = Transfer to 3♦, bust or slam invitation
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+. However, transfers (if available) are preferred.
   * 3NT = sign-off
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit.

Opener rebids:
   * 2♦ with no four-card major 
   * 2♥ with four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠ with four spades or five spades and four hearts


If responder rebids three of either minor,
he shows slam interest and at least a five-card suit.
### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card majors
   * 2♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 2♥ = transfer to spades. 

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level 
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, 
that is natural and game forcing. 
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠
   * Pass = content to play 2♠.
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3♠
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥ = natural and game forcing (usually 5+).
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠.
   * 4NT = quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit.
   * 5NT = asking for a choice between 6♠ and 6NT.

### Single-suited Hands
The Texas Transfer after a 1NT opening shows a six-card major:
   * 4♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 4♥ = transfer to spades 

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer, 
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands 
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents. 
   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Game invitation (would make a 1/1 bid): Jacoby, raise (Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.)
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Jacoby, raise to 4
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Texas, 4NT (Blackwood)

### 3 Diamonds 5-5 Majors Game-forcing
When using the 4-way transfers, the 3♦ bid is normally idle.
Instead of the traditional (1NT - 2♥ - 2♠ - 3♥), 
3♦ is now used to show a game forcing hand with both majors. 
This ensures that opener is declarer.

The other uses stay the same:
   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass = bust
   * 1NT - 2♦ - 2♥ - 2♠ = invitational
   * 1NT - 3♦ = game forcing, 5-5 in majors

Note: This treatment is a simplified version of [Richard Pavlicek's](http://rpbridge.net/7g66.htm).
### Minor Suit Stayman
A 2♠ response shows at least an invitational hand with strength in both minors.

1NT — 2♠
   * 2NT = weak hand, usually stoppers in both majors
   * 3♣, ♦ = weak hand, good support 
   * 3♥, ♠ = strong hand, stopper, could have a good minor (only forcing response)
   * 3NT = strong hand, stoppers in both majors
   * 4♣, ♦ = strong hand, good support

From there, responder should have enough information to proceed using methods described elsewhere.
### Over Interference
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

1NT — (Double) — 2♣ = Stayman

1NT — (Double) — 2♦ = transfer to hearts

If an opponent bids over your 1NT opener, Stayman and Jacoby transfers “off.” 
Bids are natural except for a cuebid, which can be used with
game forcing strength as a substitute for Stayman.

If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥ = Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts

The Texas transfer is on through 3♣. In other words it must be a jump.

## 2NT and 3NT 
Stayman and Jacoby/Texas transfers for the majors are used.

### 2NT 20-21
   * 3♣ = Stayman.
   * 3♦, 3♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively.
   * 4♣ = Gerber (ace asking).
   * 4♦, 4♥ = Texas transfers to hearts and spades, respectively.
   * 4NT = Invites a slam in notrump.

### 3NT 25-27
   * 4♣ = Stayman.
   * 4♦, 4♥ = Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively

# Major Openings 
Normally open five-card majors in all seats.

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6
## Suit Responses 
### Basic Responses Over 1♥
   * 1♠ = at least four spades, 6 or more points. Tends to deny a heart fit.
   * 2♣, 2♦ = 11 points or more, promises at least four of the suit or three-card heart support.
   * 2♥ = three-card or longer heart support; 6–10 dummy points.
   * 2♠, 3♣, 3♦ = strong jump shifts. Invites a slam.
   * 3♥ = limit raise (10–12 dummy points with four or more hearts).
   * 4♥ = usually five+ hearts, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

### Basic Responses Over 1♠
Same as above except:
   * 2♥ = 11 points or more, promises at least five of the suit.

### Splinter Raises
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening, a double jump shows 13+ dummy points,
4+ card support, and shortness in the suit bid (either a singleton or void).
Opener can explore slam by bidding controls or attempt to sign off by bidding game.
For example:

1♠ — 4♣ = game forcing, club shortness
   * 4♦, 4♥ = slam interest, first round control (usually ace)
   * 4♠ = signoff

Responder shows a void by rebidding the splinter suit:

1♠ — 4♣ 

4♥ — 5♣ = void

Opener can also splinter with a good hand and 4-card support:

1♣ — 1♠
   * 4♦, 4♥ = game forcing, shortness

In competition, splinters are off except for jumps in the opponent's suit.

Note: This is the treatment recommended by Richard Pavlicek as described in this [quiz](http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/quiz.pl?5h4100).

### Two Way Reverse Drury
In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall). 
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following: 
   * 2 of a minor shows a limit raise
      * 2♣ = 3 card support
      * 2♦ = 4+ card support
   * Opener clarifies strength with the rebid   
      * Rebidding the suit at the 2 level shows a light opener
      * any other bid shows a full opener

## NT Responses 
### 1NT
1NT shows 6–10 points and denies support for the major opened.

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

It is not forcing, but opener is expected to bid unless the hand is a minimum
with one of the following hand patterns:
   * 5-3-3-2 
   * 4=5=2=2 distribution (four spades and five hearts)

### 2NT
2NT = 13+ HCP, balanced hand, game forcing
   * New suit responses show 4+ cards

### 3NT
3NT = forcing raise, 13+, balanced hand, 4+card support
   * Cue bids in a new suit are cue bids, suggesting slam

## Rebids by Opener 
Opener’s rebids are natural and standard.
### Rebids with a minimum hand (13–16 points)
   * Rebidding notrump at the lowest available level;
   * Raising responder’s suit at the lowest level (may have good three-card support);
   * Rebidding a new suit at the one level or rebidding a new suit at the two level that
is lower ranking than the opening suit (not reversing);
   * Rebidding opener’s suit at the lowest level.

### Rebids with a medium hand (17–18 points)
   * Jump raise or jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Reverse in a new suit, i.e., bid a new suit at the two level which is higher ranking
than the opening suit;
   * Non-reverse bid in a new suit (this has the wide range of 13–18 points)

### With a maximum hand (19–21 or 22 points) opener must make a very strong rebid:
   * Jump in notrump;
   * Double jump raise of responder’s suit or double jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Jump shift in a new suit.

Responder follows up by attempting to sign off in game, bidding 4NT
Blackwood, or cuebidding if still interested in trying to cooperate with opener
in making the slam decision.

# Minor Openings 
﻿A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4–4–3–2 shape: 
four spades, four hearts, three diamonds, and two clubs, which should
be opened 1♦. 
However, it is acceptable to open 1♣ when 4-4 in the minors especially with a 
balanced hand (opener expects to bid NT next).

Responses and later bidding generally follow the ideas set down in the previous
section. Bidding at the one level is up-the-line in principle. 

Responses of 2NT and 3NT are standard:

1♣
   * 2NT = 13–16, game forcing
   * 3NT = 17–18

## Raises
Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better) 
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive).
Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣, 
though one fewer trump will do in a pinch in a competitive sequence).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.

1♦ - 2♦
   * 2♥, 2♠ = stopper
   * 2NT = balanced minimum, side suits stopped
   * 3♦ = unbalanced minimum
   * 3NT = 18-19, side suits stopped

Inverted raises are on in competition.

## Subsequent Bidding by Responder 
If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

### Sign-off
Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

1♥ — 1♠

2♣
   * Pass
   * 2♥ = 2-3 hearts, likely misfit
   * 2♠ = 6+ spades

This also applies to minor suit openings with one additional treatment.

1♣ — 1♠

1NT
   * Pass, 2♣
   * 2♠ = 6+ spades
   * 2♥ = sign-off - opener must pass or correct (5-5 or 5-4 distribution)
   
### Inviting Game
Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, 3 of opener's suit:

1♥ — 1♠

2♦ — 2NT, 3♦, 3♥ = 11–12 points, inviting game.

In addition, a new minor suit at the responder's second bid or later is forcing for one round and thus
is invitational at the 2-level and game forcing at the 3-level.

1♥ — 1♠

1NT (or 2♣) — 2♦ (forcing)

In this case, opener is encouraged to show secondary support for responder's suit. 
When more than one minor is available, it tends to show a stopper for NT.

### Forcing to Game
All second round jumps (except for opener's suit as mentioned above) 
and new suits above two of the first bid suit are forcing to 3NT or higher: 

1♥ — 1♠

1NT or 2m

   * 3♥ = game forcing (5-5 or 5-4 distribution)
   * 3♠ = game forcing (6+ cards)

Opener can sign off in game or make a slam try. 
4NT is Blackwood (see topic) only if suit agreement has been established. 
Otherwise it is quantitative, asking responder to proceed with a maximum. 
Suit bids usually show controls.

### Signing off at Game
Any bid of game is a sign-off, though partner can proceed with a maximum (see Slam Bidding).

# Strong 2♣ 
﻿A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points, or the playing equivalent. 

Responses:

2♣ 
   * 2♦= conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response.
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦= natural and game forcing. At least a five-card suit and
8 points.
   * 2NT = a balanced 8 HCP.

After a 2♦ response, opener bids a suit naturally:
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦ = natural, forcing
   * 2NT = 22-24 points (see responses for 2NT opening above)
   * 3NT = 28+ points (see responses for 3NT opening above)

In response to a suit rebid, responder indicates strength.

2♣ — 2♦

2♥ 
   * 2♠, 3♦ = natural, game force
   * 3♣ = artificial, very weak (0-4, not an ace)
   * 3NT = no support, 5-7 points
   * 3♥ = positive, slam invitational
   * 4♥ = sign-off
   
# Weak Two Bids of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ 
A weak two-bid generally shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. 
A good five-card suit is possible, especially when non-vulnerable.
A poor seven-card suit is also possible when it is not good enough to open with at the three level. 

Responses:
   * 2NT: forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) 
   * Raise: to play, could be preemptive.
   * 3NT: to play.
   * New suit: non-forcing (alertable), showing a better preempt.

After a 2NT response,
   * Rebid original suit: weaker and/or longer suit
   * New suit: “feature” (ace or king in that suit)
   * 3NT: AKJ or better, no feature

# Slam Bidding 
## Roman Key-Card Blackwood 1430
Once suit agreement has been reached, 4NT is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump. 

4NT KC Asking:
   * 5♣ = 1 or 4 keycards
   * 5♦ = 3 or 0 keycards
   * 5♥ = 2 keycards, no queen of trump
   * 5♠ = 2 keycards, queen of trump

After a 5♣ or 5♦ response, the Blackwood initiator may ask for the queen of trump
(or extra trump length) by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement) - 4NT - 5♣ - 5♦ = Queen ask
      * 5♥ = no queen
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦ = queen, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 6♥ = queen, no lower kings


### With (Useful) Voids
After 4NT, responder can show voids with at least one keycard:
   * 5NT = even number of keycards (never zero)
   * 6 of void suit = odd number of keycards
   * 6 of trump suit = odd number of keycards, void is in higher suit

### 5NT
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.



## Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over any 1NT OR 2NT by partner, including a rebid of
1NT OR 2NT. Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦ = 0 aces
   * 4♥ = 1 ace
   * 4♠ = 2 aces
   * 4NT = 3 aces

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦ = 0 or 4 kings
   * 5♥ = 1 king
   * 5♠ = 2 kings
   * 5NT = 3 kings

## 5NT Pick a Slam
A voluntary bid of 5NT is forcing and asks partner to try to pick the best slam available.
There are no hard-and-fast rules here, but possibilities include:
   * bidding a new 4-card suit (looking for a 4-4 fit)
   * supporting partner with mild support (looking for a good 7-card fit)
   * rebidding a previously bid suit with unannounced length and/or strength
   * returning to 6NT with no better options

The asker may continue to bid up the line if completely displeased with the response.

# Defensive Bidding 
## Overcalls
Overcalls show 8–16 points (double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
though it can be lighter at the minimum end.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in a suit is natural.

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid two suits is natural in either suit.

## NT Overcalls
### Direct
A 1NT overcall shows 15–18 points and a balanced hand (preferably a stopper in
opener’s suit). All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 19-21 points.

### Reopening
A reopening 1NT after an opponent has opened shows 10–14 points. 
This is a wide range, but there will not usually be a game on for you.

To show a stronger hand, double then bid 1NT to show 15-18 points 
or jump to 2NT to show 19-21.

### Vs. Preempts
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall in notrump is natural.
## Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
When vulnerable it shows at least opening strength
but when nonvulnerable it can be fairly light.

(1♦) - 2NT = hearts and clubs

Note: Unusual 2NT is off in the reopening seat (see above).
## Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). If the opening is in a minor suit,
the cuebid shows the majors; if the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

(1♦) — 2♦ = at least 5–5 in the majors, 8 points or more.

(1♠) — 2♠ = at least 5–5 in hearts and a minor; 10 points or more.

Responder can bid 2NT over a major suit cuebid to ask for partner’s minor.

(1♥) — 2♥ — (Pass) — 2NT (asks for the minor).
   * 3♣ = club suit.
   * 3♦ = diamond suit.

## Doubles
A double is for takeout over an opening partscore bid (4♦ or lower); penalty over
opening game bids (4♥ or higher). 

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational. 
To force, responder cuebids opener’s suit.
# Preemptive Bids
Opening suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and based on playing tricks
(the number of tricks you expect to take if your long suit is trumps).
Overbid based on the rule of 2-3-4:
   * vulnerable vs. nonvulnerable: overbid by 2 tricks
   * equal vulnerability: overbid by 3 tricks
   * nonvulnerable vs. vulnerable: overbid by 4 tricks

Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:
   * more than one outside trick
   * a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better
   * a void in a minor

Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.
# Competitive Bidding 
There is almost an endless variety of possible sequences, so it pays to have simple
guidelines to prevent bidding misunderstandings.

Bids mean the same things they meant without the intervening bid. Still, it is
sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠J43 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣J3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

## Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows a limit raise or better:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = limit raise or better.

Note: If playing inverted minors ON in competition, then that treatment supercedes this one.

When using this treatment, a jump raise is weak / competitive.

1♠ - (2♣) - 3♠ = weak, 4+ card support

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+  

## Weak Jump Shifts
In a competitive sequence, jump shifts are weak, showing a similar hand to a preempt.
To make a strong jump shift in competition:
   * Double/Redouble and bid a new suit
   * Cue bid opponent's suit and raise

## With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (12–14 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

## Against Conventions
If the opponents use a convention (such as Michaels or the unusual notrump), you
can double to show at least 10 points, or you can cuebid one of their shown suits
to force to game.
1♠ — (2♠) 
   * 3♥ = game force.
   * Double = at least 10 points, probably balanced.

## Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major. 
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level. 
With insufficient points, double may also be used with a five-card suit.

1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.

1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).

1♦ — (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–10 points.

1♠ — (4♦) — Double = four hearts and 10+ points or five hearts and 8-10 points.
## Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double:

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * 2NT = limit raise (at least 10 points) — or better.
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, but it is better to make a more
descriptive bid of 1♥, 1♠, or 2NT with the appropriate hand.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

A responder’s jump shift after a double is to play:

1♦ — (Double) — 2♥, 2♠, 3♣ = six-plus card suit, like a weak two-bid or
preemptive three-bid.
## Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.

# Defensive Leads and Signals 
Signals are:
   1. Attitude
   1. Count
   1. Suit preference

First discard is Odd/Even. Odd encourages, even discourages.

Leads are: 
   * top of touching honors and interior sequences.
   * A from A–K–x
   * 4th best from x-x-x-x or x-x-x-x-x. 
   * Top from x–x–x.

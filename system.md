This branch describes an experimental system called the Slar Diamond.
## General Approach 
Strong Diamond with weak notrumps and occasional four-card majors

Strong forcing openings: 1♦, 3NT, 4NT;
## Balanced Openings 
Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is particularly strong. 
Semi-balanced hands with either 5-4-2-2 or 6-3-2-2 distribution 
may be treated as balanced if the doubletons are Qx or better. 

A hand may be upgraded 1 point for a long suit with good texture (e.g., QJT9x)
and downgraded 1 point for a 4-3-3-3 hand with poor texture (e.g., AJx-KJx-Axx-Qxxx).

The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:

   * 12-14: Open 1NT
   * 15-17: Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT
   * 18-21: Open strong, rebid NT
   * 22+: Open strong, jump NT

### 1NT 12-14 
#### Basic Responses
2NT = Invitational 8-9

3NT = sign-off

#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit (Garbage Stayman).
Usually responder will have 8+ HCPs (assuming a 15-17 1NT range).

Opener rebids:

   * 2♦ with no four-card major 
   * 2♥ with four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠ with five spades (possibly with four hearts) or four spades

After 2♥ or 2♠: 
   * 2♠ (over 2♥) or 3♥ (over 2♠): forcing raise slam interest, no splinter
   * 3 of that major: invitational
   * 3♠ (over 2♥), 4♣, 4♦, 4♥ (over 2♠): forcing raise, slam interest, that splinter
   * 4 of that major: signoff
   * 4NT after any forcing raise is Blackwood
   
After any response:
   * 2NT: invitational with an unbid major
   * 3♣, 3♦: five cards, slam interest
   * 3NT: signoff with an unbid major (choice of games)
   * 4NT: quantitative

#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major. 
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):

   * 2♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 2♥ = transfer to spades. 

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level 
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, 
that is natural and game forcing. 
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠

   * Pass = content to play 2♠.
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3♠
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥ = natural and game forcing (4+).
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠.
   * 4NT = quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit.
   * 5NT = asking for a choice between 6♠ and 6NT.

#### Single-suited Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major. 
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):

   * 4♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 4♥ = transfer to spades 

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer, 
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands 
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents. 
The following shows how they are used with strong NT (15-17) openings.

   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Game invitation (would make a 1/1 bid): Jacoby, raise (Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.)
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Jacoby, raise to 4 in suit
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Texas, 4NT (Blackwood)
   * Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors): Texas, 5NT

It is rare, but a direct bid of 4♠ or 6♠ is to play and is only used when your hand is not amenable to transferring.
#### 5-5 Majors
When using the Jacoby transfer, it is possible to show 5-5 in the majors 
with a number of hand types.

   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass = bust
   * 1NT - 2♦ - 2♥ - 2♠ = invitational
   * 1NT - 2♥ - 2♠ - 3♥ = game forcing

#### Smolen 5-4 or better in the Majors
Unless responder is weak, 5-4 in the majors is shown with a Stayman sequence as follows:

   * 2♣, pass: weak, four diamonds
   * transfer to five-card major, pass: weak, less than four diamonds
   * 2♣, 2♥ or 2♠: that major, invitational
   * 2♣, 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 2♣, 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Over 2NT, a similar system applies but there are no invitational bids:

   * 3♣, pass: weak, four diamonds
   * transfer to five-card major, pass: weak, less than four diamonds
   * 3♣, 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 2♣, 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Smolen does not apply over 3NT.

#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor that are either a bust or slam invitational.

   * 2NT = transfer to clubs
   * 3♣ = transfer to diamonds

Opener accepts the transfer unless game is reachable opposite nothing more than Qxxxxx.

When using this treatment, responder bids 2♣ (Stayman) with any game invitational hand. 
A rebid of 2NT over a 2♦ or 2♠ response shows an invitational hand that may or may not have a four-card major.
#### Other Responses
   * 3♥, 3♠ = at least a six-card suit and slam interest (otherwise,
responder uses a transfer bid).
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

#### Over Interference
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

1NT — (Double) — 2♣ = Stayman

1NT — (Double) — 2♦ = transfer to hearts

With a bad hand and a weak minor, redouble for SOS.

1NT — (Double) — Redouble = Rescue - weak with a long minor (opener bids 2♣, pass or correct).

Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents is for penalty.

Jacoby Transfers are on over 2♣.

Double of an artificial 2♣ = Stayman, does not imply invitational or better values. 

Cue bid of opponent's natural suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥ = Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts

Suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.

   * 2♥, 2♠ = To play, 5+.
   * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.

The Texas transfer is on through 3♣. In other words it must be a jump.

### 2NT and 3NT 
#### 2NT Minors
2NT shows an intermediate hand (generally 10-14 HCP)
with at least five diamonds and at least four clubs. 
(The hands must either be equal in length or have longer diamonds.) It is forcing.
All responses except 4NT are natural and non-forcing though opener can bid again with extra length.
   * 3♣, 3♦ = preference
   * 3♥, 3♠, 3NT, 4♥, 4♠ = natural, non-forcing
   * 4NT = Ace-asking (normal Blackwood)
#### 3NT Strong Preempt
3NT shows a strong preempt, generally no more than one outside trick but 
too strong for an immediate bid at the 4-level.
   * 4♣ = normal response, opener passes or corrects
   * 4♦ = 2 aces
   * 4♥, 4♠ = natural, non-forcing
   * 4NT = 3 aces

This approach was developed by Richard Pavlicek and is further described [here](http://rpbridge.net/7g74.htm).
#### 4NT Blackwood Opening
An opening of 4NT shows a rare hand that is solid except for aces or kings.
Standard Blackwood responses are used.
## Major Openings 
To be biddable, a major suit must be as good as or better than one of the following:
   * Six cards
   * Kxxxx with shortness (singleton or void)
   * KQxxx with no shortness
   * AQJx with a doubleton
   * AQxx with shortness

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.
Opening bids are lighter than in standard methods. 
In general if you would overcall in SAYC then you can open here.

### NT Responses 
#### 1NT Forcing
1NT typically shows 6–12 points and is used in a number of circumstances:
   * No support for the major opened 
   * A three-card limit raise
   * A bust hand with otherwise good trump support (too weak for a direct raise)

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

It is 100% forcing by an unpassed hand so responder must be prepared for a three-card response or a rebid with only five cards.

### Raises 
TODO 
### Jump Shifts 
#### Weak Jump Shift
A jump shift shows a weak hand (less than invitational values) and 6+ cards. Opener must pass without good support.

1♠
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥: weak

To show an invitational hand, bid 1NT and then jump or reverse.

1♠ — 1NT — 2♦
   * 3♣, 3♥: invitational

## Minor Openings 
﻿## 1♣ Opening
A 1♣ opening shows 4+ clubs and an unbalanced 13-19 DP or 2+ clubs and a balanced 16-18 DP.

### 1♦ Response
A 1♦ response is artificial and forcing.
It is the default response if no other response applies and there is no desire to play 1♣. 
It asks opener to further describe the hand.
All rebids by opener are nonforcing and natural:
   * 1♥ or 1♠: an unbalanced 13-17 DP and 4 of that major. (If both majors are held, bid 1♠ and show hearts later if needed.)
   * 1NT: a balanced 16-18 DP. (See below for continuations)
   * 2♣: an unbalanced 13-17 DP and 6+ cards in the suit.
   * 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠: a maximum (18-19 DP) unbalanced hand with 4 cards in the suit. 
   * 3♣: a maximum (18-19 DP) and 6+ cards in the suit. 

#### 1NT Rebid
After a 1NT rebid, the following responses apply:
   * 2♦: Natural (weak 2 strength)
   * 2♥/2♠: Weak, 5 of that major and 4 of the other major
   * All others: same as 1NT opening but adjusted for higher strength

### 1♥ or 1♠ Response
A response in a major shows 5+ cards and is forcing.
   * Lowest unbid suit: artificial, unbalanced, denies support
   * One step below a single raise: a maximum raise
   * 1NT: a balanced 16-18 DP without good support
   * Single raise: minimal support
   * 2♣ or 3♣: see above

### 1NT Response
This shows a balanced hand with 9-12 DP and no four-card major.
This is forcing. With a balanced hand, opener treats it as invitational and bids 2NT or 3NT.
With an unbalanced hand, opener bids the second suit with a minimum or shows shortness at the 3-level with a maximum.

### 2♣ Response
This shows good support (11+ DP and usually 5+ cards) and no four-card major.
This is forcing. With a balanced hand, opener bids 3NT. 
Otherwise stoppers are bid up the line until a safe NT contract is reached or someone retreats to clubs.

### Suit responses of 2♦ or higher
These bids are weak (less than a normal weak 2 or preempt) and natural. 
Opener is expected to pass without good support.

### 2NT Response
This shows a balanced hand of opening strength.
Opener raises with a balanced hand and rebids a short suit with an unbalanced hand.

### 3♣ Response
This shows a weak hand (10 or fewer DP and usually 5+ cards) and no four-card major.
Opener will usually pass but in rare circumstances will raise or bid 3NT.

## 2♦ Opening
A 2♦ opening shows 5+ diamonds and an unbalanced 13-19 DP or a balanced 16-18 DP.

### 2♥ or 2♠ Response
These bids are forcing and promise 9+ DP with diamond tolerance or 11+ without.
Opener will support with four-card support, bid 2NT if balanced, or bid another suit to show a stopper.

### 2NT Response
Shows 11+ DP with stoppers in unbid suits (particularly majors). It is forcing. 
Opener rebids are as follows:
   * 3♦: minimum
   * 3 of another suit: shortness, non-minimum
   * 3NT: balanced
   
### Direct Raises
Direct raises to any level are weak and preemptive.

OneOverOne\Reverses\SAYC.md 
## Strong 1♦ 
﻿A 1♦ opening shows most hands with 18+ HCPs. 
In general responder acts as if opener is balanced.

### 1♥ Response
Shows a bust - 0-4 HCP, no ace, no five-card suit (would pass a standard 2NT opening). 
Opener attempts to set the contract:
   * pass/1♠/2♣/2♦: natural, unbalanced
   * 1NT: 18-21 HCP
   * 2♥/2♠/2NT/3♣/3♦: invitational

### 1♠ Response
Shows a number of weak and intermediate hand types:
   * 5+ hearts 0-7 HCP
   * four-card major 5-7 HCP
   * balanced 5-7 HCP

Opener's responses:
   * 1NT: balanced or semi-balanced 18-21 HCP (systems on)
      * 2♣: Stayman
	  * 2♦: transfer to 2♥
	  * 2NT: balanced, invitational
   * 2NT: balanced or semi-balanced 22+ HCP (systems on)
   * other suit bids: natural, unbalanced
   
### 1NT Response
Shows a weak (0-4 HCP) or intermediate (5-7 HCP) hand with 5+ clubs, diamonds, or spades.

Opener's responses:
   * 2♣: 18-21 HCP, balanced, semi-balanced, or clubs
      * pass or correct to 2♦
	  * 2♥: transfer to 2♠
   * 3♣: 22+ HCP, balanced, semi-balanced, or clubs
   * other suit bids: natural, unbalanced

### 2♣ Response
Game forcing (8+ HCP), Stayman.

Openers responses:
   * 2♦: 18-21 HCP, balanced, semi-balanced, or diamonds
   * 2♥, 2♠: That major (any strength)
   * 2NT: 21+ HCP, balanced or semi-balanced

### 2♦, 2♥ Response
Game forcing (8+ HCP), Jacoby Transfer.

Openers responses:
   * accept transfer: 18-21 HCP, balanced or semi-balanced
   * super-accept: 22+ HCP, good fit
   * other suit bids: natural, unbalanced

### 2♠ Response
Game forcing (8+ HCP), balanced, no four-card major.

Openers responses:
   * 2NT: 18-21 or 25+ HCP, balanced or semi-balanced
   * 3NT: 22-24 HCP, balanced or semi-balanced
   * other suit bids: natural, unbalanced

### 2NT Response
Game forcing (8+ HCP), good minor.

Openers responses:
   * 3♣: balanced, semi-balanced, or clubs
   * 3♦/3♥/3♠: natural
   
### 3♣, 3♦, 3♥, 3♠ Response
Game forcing (10+ HCP), shortness in that suit.

Openers responses:
   * 3NT: 18-21 HCP, balanced or semi-balanced
   * 4NT: 22+ HCP, balanced or semi-balanced
   * other suit bids: natural, unbalanced

### 4♦, 4♥ Response
Texas Transfer, semi-solid or solid suit.

Openers responses:
   * accept transfer: 18-21 HCP, fair support (stiff honor or small doubleton)
   * super-accept: 22+ HCP, good fit
   * other suit bids: natural, unbalanced

### Over Interference
#### Double or One-Level
   * Double/Redouble: bust
   * Pass: intermediate, five-card major or balanced
   * 1♥/1♠: intermediate with shortness in that major 
   * 1NT: intermediate with at least one minor
   * 2♣ and higher: same as without interference
   
#### Two-Level or higher:
   * Pass: intermediate or bust
   * Double: penalty
   * Other non-jump: natural, game-forcing
   * Other jump: same as without interference
   
## Weak Two Bids of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ 
A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. On rare
occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. It is possible to open a weak two with
a poor seven-card suit (not good enough to open with at the three level). 

Responses:

A 2NT response is forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) Opener rebids his suit with a
minimum weak two (5–8 points). With a maximum hand opener bids another
suit to show a “feature” (ace or king in that suit); 
with a solid suit (AKJxxx or better) he raises to 3NT.

Any raise of opener’s suit is to play and could be preemptive. 

A 3NT response is also to play.

“RONF” on the card means “Raise Only Non-Force.” A new-suit response is forcing
one round and shows at least a five-card suit. Opener should raise a major suit
response with a three-card fit, or perhaps with a doubleton honor.

With no fit for responder’s suit, opener rebids:
   * With a minimum weak two-bid (5–8 points), rebid the suit at the lowest level.
   * With a maximum weak two-bid, name a new suit or bid notrump.
   
## Slam Bidding 
### Roman Key-Card Blackwood 1430
Once suit agreement has been reached, 4NT is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump. 

4NT KC Asking:
   * 5♣ = 1 or 4 keycards
   * 5♦ = 3 or 0 keycards
   * 5♥ = 2 keycards, no queen of trump
   * 5♠ = 2 keycards, queen of trump

After a 5♣ or 5♦ response, the Blackwood initiator may ask for the queen of trump
(or extra trump length) by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement) - 4NT - 5♣ - 5♦ = Queen ask
      * 5♥ = no queen
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦ = queen, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 5NT = queen, no kings
	  * 6♥ = queen, ♠K


#### With (Useful) Voids
After 4NT, responder can show voids with at least one keycard:
   * 5NT = even number of keycards (never zero)
   * 6 of void suit = odd number of keycards
   * 6 of trump suit = odd number of keycards, void is in higher suit

#### 5NT
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.



### Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over any 1NT OR 2NT by partner, including a rebid of
1NT OR 2NT. Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦ = 0 aces
   * 4♥ = 1 ace
   * 4♠ = 2 aces
   * 4NT = 3 aces

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦ = 0 or 4 kings
   * 5♥ = 1 king
   * 5♠ = 2 kings
   * 5NT = 3 kings

### 5NT Pick a Slam
A voluntary bid of 5NT is forcing and asks partner to try to pick the best slam available.
There are no hard-and-fast rules here, but possibilities include:
   * bidding a new 4-card suit (looking for a 4-4 fit)
   * supporting partner with mild support (looking for a good 7-card fit)
   * rebidding a previously bid suit with unannounced length and/or strength
   * returning to 6NT with no better options

The asker may continue to bid up the line if completely displeased with the response.

### Grand Slam Force
A jump to 5NT (and some 5NT bids when the auction is at the five level) is “Grand
Slam Force,” asking partner to bid a grand slam with two of the three top trump
honors:

5NT
   * 6 of the trump suit = fewer than two top trump honors (A, K, or Q).
   * 7 of the trump suit = two of the three top trump honors.

### Voluntary 5-bid
A voluntary bid of 5 of a suit is invitational to slam.
It is used in two circumstances: 
   * If opponents have bid one suit or there is one unbid suit, it asks for second-round control in that suit. Responder:
      * Bids 5NT with an unguarded K to invite an alternative contract of 6NT
	  * Raises to 6 with first or second-round control
	  * Passes otherwise
   * Otherwise, it asks for top trump honors. Responder 
      * Raises to 7 with AK and the Q or extra length
	  * Raises to 6 with at least AJ or KQ
	  * Passes otherwise

## Defensive Bidding 
### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 8–16 points nonvulnerable and 10-16 points vulnerable
(double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
In general an overcall shows 5+ cards 
but it may show a strong 4 (AKJx) at the one level.
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural.

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

The one exception is over 1♣ where an overcall of 1♦ does little to obstruct the opponents.
(1♣)
   * 1♦ = a good 4, often lead-directing
   * 2♦ = sound overcall (would bid over 1♠)
   
When the opponents have bid two suits,
an overcall in either suit is natural.

### NT Overcalls

With appropriate strength and a stopper in the opponent's suit,
you may make a NT overcall.

Hand|Direct|Reopening|2-level|3-level
-----|--------|------|-------|---------
10-14|pass or double then pass|pass or 1NT|pass|pass
15-18|1NT|double then 1NT|2NT|maybe 3NT
19-21|double then bid NT|2NT|3NT|3NT
22-24|double then jump NT|3NT|3NT|3NT

All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
(It may show 4-5-2-2 distribution but in that case it should be a king stronger.)

(1♦) - 2NT = hearts and clubs

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.

In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Note: Unusual 2NT is off in the reopening seat (see above).
### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

   * If the opening is in a minor suit, the cuebid shows the majors; 
   * If the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.
When vulnerable, it is best to avoid very weak hands. 
(This also makes it easier for advancer to decide to bid game.)
When non-vulnerable, the low-end range is much wider. 

#### Responses to a Minor Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
1. 2NT: Invitational
1. Opponent's suit: Game or slam try

#### Responses to a Major Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
2. Jump in major: Weak if below game
1. 2NT: asks for overcaller’s minor.
   * If advancer then returns to the major, this is invitational.
   * If there is further interference, 4NT may also ask for the minor.

#### Rare Responses to Either Cuebid

2. Jump in major: Good support, but weak if below game
1. Unbid minor (no further interference): Weak
1. 3NT: To play

#### Overcaller Rebids
Overcaller will normally have a weak hand and will pass or make a minimum response. 
With a strong hand or freakier distribution, overcaller will make some other bid.
### Doubles
A double is for takeout over an opening partscore bid (4♦ or lower); penalty over
opening game bids (4♥ or higher). 
However, advancer may pull the double with undisclosed length and/or poor defensive values.

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational (9-12 declarer points). 
To force for one round, responder cuebids opener’s suit.
Any subsequent bid by doubler shows significant extras and is strongly invitational to game. 
If advancer has jumped, then a new suit or NT bid by doubler is forcing to game.
### Landy vs 1NT
#### Unpassed Hand
Landy is a simple defense to 1NT with only one artificial bid:
   * Double: Penalty
   * 2♣: Majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
   * 2NT: Minors
   * Others: Natural

After 2♣, advancer bids the better major or 2♦ to defer to partner.

#### Passed Hand
Since it is impossible to have a penalty double as a passed hand,
double is a relay to 2♣.
## Preemptive Bids
Opening major suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and based on playing tricks
(the number of tricks you expect to take if your long suit is trumps).
Overbid based on the rule of 2-3-4:
   * vulnerable vs. nonvulnerable: overbid by 2 tricks
   * equal vulnerability: overbid by 3 tricks
   * nonvulnerable vs. vulnerable: overbid by 4 tricks

In a minor, preempts are less predictable so be cautious about raising 
with a balanced hand.
   
Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:
   * more than one outside trick
   * a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better
   * a void in a minor

Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.
## Competitive Bidding 
It is sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠J43 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣J3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

### New Suits
In a competitive sequence, new suits by an unpassed hand are forcing.
(To make a constructive, non-forcing bid, consider a Negative Double.)
New suits by a passed hand are constructive but non-forcing.

Jump shifts are weak, showing a similar hand to a preempt.

### Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows a limit raise or better:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = limit raise or better.

Note: If playing inverted minors ON in competition, then that treatment supercedes this one.

### Jump Raise
When using this treatment, a jump raise is weak / competitive.

1♠ - (2♣) - 3♠ = weak, 4+ card support

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+  

### With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

#### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (12–14 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

### Against Conventions
After partner opens in a suit and a conventional bid by the opponents shows one known suit, 
a cue bid shows a good raise, a double shows a good hand without support, and other bids are weak. 
For example:

1♠ — (2♠:Michaels) 
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: weak
   * 3♥: Limit raise or better in spades.
   * Double: at least 10 points, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

If the conventional bid shows two known suits, 
there are two cue bids available, the first shows the fourth suit and the second shows good support. 
For example:

1♣ — (2NT:Unusual) 
   * 3♣, 3♠: weak
   * 3♦: 10+HCP, 5+ spades
   * 3♥: Limit raise or better in clubs.
   * Double: at least 10 points, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

### Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major. 
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level. 
With insufficient points, double may also be used with a five-card suit.

   * 1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.
   * 1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).
   * 1♦ — (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–6 points.
   * 1♠ — (4♦) — Double = four hearts and 10+ points or five hearts and 8-10 points.

If both majors are bid, then a double shows both minors.
   * 1♥ — (1♠) — Double = 4-4 or better in the minors.

When the opponents overcall a minor over a minor at the two-level or higher, 
a double shows at least one four-card major.

   * 1♦ — (2♣) — Double = at least one four-card major.
   * 1♣ — (2♦) — Double = at least one four-card major.

If opener bids the a major you cannot support, 
rebid opener's first suit or NT to imply the other major.

### Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double, bid as naturally as possible.

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 1NT = non-forcing, 6-9 points, no four-card major or four-card support
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, could have good support.
   * 2♦ = weak, four-card trump support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

1♥ — (Double)
   * 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 1NT = non-forcing, 6-9 points.
   * 2♣, 2♦ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, could have a limit raise.
   * 2♥ = weak, generally three-card support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 2NT = game force (Jacoby)
   * 3♥ = weak, generally four-card support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 4♥ = natural, could be preemptive

### Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;
   * the opponents make a penalty double of 1NT and partner passes:
      * 1NT — (Double) — pass — (pass) — Redouble = Penalty, responder passes or scrambles;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.

## Defensive Leads and Signals 
The following are specified:

Defensive signals when following suit or discarding are “high encourages, low
discourages.” Leads are top of touching honors (with choices from A–K–x and
interior sequences).

Pairs must choose from the following options.

Where no card is pre-marked in bold Italics, pairs must mark their leads.
   * Which card is led from A–K–x.
   * Which card is led from x–x–x, x–x–x–x, or x–x–x–x–x.
   * Whether 4th best, or 3rd & 5th best leads are used.
   * Whether 3rd best is led from K–J–10–x, K–10–9–x, or Q–10–9–x (and from
A–J–10–x, or A–10–9–x vs. notrump). Must be indicated by circling the card
led.
   * Whether or not frequent count signals are given.

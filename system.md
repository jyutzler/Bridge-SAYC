This branch contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes the bridge system
used by Jeff Yutzler and Mike Corrigan. 
It is a 2 over 1 game force (no exceptions) with a number of conventions.

## General Approach 
Two-over-one game forcing with five-card majors

Strong forcing opening: 2♣;
## Notrump Opening Bids 
Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is particularly strong. 
Semi-balanced hands with either 5-4-2-2 or 6-3-2-2 distribution 
may be treated as balanced if the doubletons are Qx or better. 

A hand may be upgraded 1 point for a long suit with good texture (e.g., QJT9x)
and downgraded 1 point for a 4-3-3-3 hand with poor texture (e.g., AJx-KJx-Axx-Qxxx).

The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:

   * 12-14: Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT
   * 15-17: Open 1NT
   * 18-19: Open 1 of a suit, jump NT
   * 20-21: Open 2NT
   * 22-24: Open 2♣, rebid NT
   * 25-27: Open 3NT
   * 28+: Open 2♣, jump NT

### 1NT 15-17 
#### Basic Responses
   * 2♣: Stayman (also for invitational hands)
   * 3NT: sign-off
   * 4♣: Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * 4NT: natural, quantitative invite to 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit (Garbage Stayman).
Usually responder will have 8+ HCPs (assuming a 15-17 1NT range).

Opener rebids:

   * 2♦: no four-card major
   * 2♥: four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠: five spades (possibly with four hearts) or four spades

Responder's rebids after 2♥ or 2♠:
   * 2♠ (over 2♥): four spades, denies four hearts
   * 3♠ (over 2♥) or 3♥ (over 2♠): forcing raise, slam interest, requests cue bid
   * 3 of that major: invitational
   * 4 of that major: signoff

Responder's rebids after any response:
   * 2NT: invitational, not necessarily with an unbid major
   * 3♣, 3♦: five cards, slam interest
   * 3NT: signoff with an unbid major (choice of games)
   * 4♣: Gerber (key card if over a major)
   * 4♦, 4♥ (over 2♠): unused
   * 4NT: quantitative

#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major.
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦: transfer to hearts
   * 2♥: transfer to spades

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥: normal acceptance of the transfer
   * 3♥: 17 points and four-card heart support

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit,
that is natural and game forcing.
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥; 2♠
   * Pass: content to play 2♠
   * 2NT: invitational with a five-card suit
      * Pass or 3♠: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * 3♣, 3♦: natural (4+), slam interest
   * 3NT: asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠
   * 4NT: quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit
   * 5NT: Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors)
   * 6♠: pick a slam (pass or correct)

#### Single-suited Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major.
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):

   * 4♦: transfer to hearts
   * 4♥: transfer to spades

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer,
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents.
The following shows how they are used with strong NT (15-17) openings.

   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Invitational with a six-card suit (would make a 1 over 1 bid): Jacoby, raise to 3; Opener rebids:
      * pass: minimum
      * 3NT (rare - usually requires three cards and a balanced hand) or 4M: maximum
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Two options:
      * Jacoby, raise to 4 in suit (balanced)
      * Jacoby, jump in another suit (splinter)
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Two options:
      * Texas, 4NT (Blackwood) OR 
      * Jacoby, other major (requests cue bids)
   * Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors): Texas, 5NT

It is rare, but a direct bid of 4♠ or 6♠ is to play and is only used when your hand is not amenable to transferring (for example, an unprotected king).

#### 2-level:
A transfer at the 2-level is used with certain hands with the majors.
   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass: bust
   * 2♦(transfer) followed by 2♠: 6 hearts, slam try (request to cue bid)
   * 2♥(transfer) followed by 3♥: 6 spades, slam try (request to cue bid)

#### 3-level: 5-5 hands
The 3-level is used to show most 5-5 hands.

   * 3♣: 5-5 minors, weak
   * 3♦: 5-5 minors, game forcing
   * 3♥: 5-5 majors, invitational
   * 3♠: 5-5 majors, choice of games

#### 4-level
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

#### Smolen 5-4 or better in the Majors
If responder is weak, transfer to the five-card major and pass.
Otherwise use a Stayman to show 5-4 in the majors as follows:

1NT — 2♣; 2♦
   * pass: weak (5-4=4=0 distribution)
   * 2♥ or 2♠: that major, invitational
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Over 2NT, a similar system applies but there are no invitational bids:

2NT — 3♣; 3♦
   * pass: weak  (5-4=4=0 distribution)
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Smolen does not apply over 3NT.

#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor.

   * 2♠ = transfer to clubs
      * 2NT: preacceptance (good support)
      * 3♣: normal response
   * 2NT = transfer to diamonds
      * 3♦: normal response
      * 3♣: preacceptance (good support)

#### After Opponent's Double 
* All systems are on.
* Redouble: long minor (relay to 2♣, pass or correct)

#### After Opponent's 2♣ Overcall
All systems are on after 2♣. Double of 2♣ is Stayman.

#### After Opponent's Overcall of 2♦ or Higher
Over any overcall of 2♦ or higher:
* double: Penalty at the 2-level, Negative at the 3-level
* suit bid of an unshown suit: to play (less than invitational values)
* suit bid of a shown suit: takeout
* 2NT through 3♥: Transfer to the next higher suit, invitational or better values
   * Transfer to opponent's suit: Stayman
   * 3♣ after 2NT (unusual) overcall: Stayman
* 3♠: Asks for a stopper
* 3NT: To play
* 4♣: Gerber
* 4♦ or 4♥ (through 4♣): Texas Transfer, or splinter slam try if transfer would be into opponent's suit

Note: This system is influenced by Richard Pavlicek's [system](http://rpbridge.net/7g67.htm)

### 2NT and 3NT 
 Stayman and Jacoby transfers for the majors are used.

#### 2NT 20-21
   * 3♣: Puppet Stayman
   * 3♦, 3♥: Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively
   * 4♣: Gerber (ace asking)
   * 4NT: Quantitative for 6NT
   * 5NT: Quantitative for 7NT

#### 3NT 25-27
   * 4♣: Stayman
   * 4♦, 4♥: Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively
   * 4NT: Quantitative for 6NT
   * 5NT: Quantitative for 7NT

## Major Openings 
Normally open five-card majors in all seats.

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.
### 1♠ Over 1♥
Since the immediate objective is to support with support, 
1♠ must be skipped in favor of heart support without invitational values.

#### After any Rebid by Opener
   - pass: minimum, 4 or 5 spades
   - 2♠: minimum, 6+ spades
   - 2NT: 4 spades, 11-12 HCP
   - 3♥: invitational, 3-card limit raise, usually 5 spades
   - 3♠: As per 1 over 1 system
   - 3NT: 4 spades, 13-15 HCP
   - 4♥: Game-forcing, minimum hand
   - 4♠: To play, 7+ spades
   - 4NT: quantitative, 16-17 HCP

#### After 1NT Rebid
   - 2♣ or 2♦: See New Minor Forcing below
   - 2♥: preference (rare, 2 hearts and concern about NT)

#### After 2♣ or 2♦ Rebid
   - raise minor: invitational
   - other minor: See Fourth Suit Forcing below
   - 2♥: preference (2 hearts and no more than 3 of the minor)

### NT Responses 
#### 1NT Forcing
1NT typically shows 6–12 points and is used in a number of circumstances:
   * No support for the major opened
   * A three-card limit raise
   * A bust hand with otherwise good trump support (too weak for a direct raise)

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

It is 100% forcing by an unpassed hand so responder must be prepared for a three-card response or a rebid with only five cards.


Responder can sign off or invite game with the rebid
   * other 2-level bid: weak hand, sign-off (opener may raise 1♠-1NT;2m-2♥ with 5=4-0-4 distribution and a good hand)
   * 2 of major: sign-off (2-card support or hand too weak for a direct raise)
   * 2♠ after 1♥-1NT;2m: good support of minor (impossible spade)
   * single raise of minor: good support (could be weak especially if 2♠ is available)
   * 2NT: balanced invite (11-12)
   * 3♥ after 1♠-1NT;2♥: invitational
   * 3X: invitational (usually a 6-card suit)
   * 3 of major: three-card limit raise

### Raises 
The following assumes a 1♥ opening but the system over 1♠ is similar. 
#### General
   * 2♥: three-card support, 7–10 dummy points (strong enough to accept at least one game try).
   * 4♥: usually five+ cards, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

#### Bergen Raises
Bergen raises show 4 or more cards in support of opener's major.
   * 3♣: 4+ card mixed raise (7-10 dummy points)
      * 3♦: game try
   * 3♦: 4+ card limit raise (11–12 dummy points)
   * 3♥: 4+ card preemptive raise (6 or fewer dummy points)

#### Bromad Raises
As a passed hand or over a double, Bromad Raises are used in addition to Bergen Raises.
   * 2♣: 3-card constructive raise (7-10 dummy points)
   * 2♦: 3-card limit raise (11-12 dummy points)
   * 2♥: 3-card courtesy raise (6 or fewer dummy points)

#### Other Bids after a Takeout Double
   * Redouble: game-forcing raise or 10+HCP without support
   * 2NT: weak with one long minor (opener bids 3♣, pass or correct)

#### Jacoby 2NT
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening:

   * 2NT: Game-forcing raise (13+ dummy points, 4+ trumps, all hand patterns). 
Asks opener to describe his hand to help responder evaluate slam prospects.

      * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: singleton or void in that suit.
      * 4♥: minimum hand.
      * 3NT: medium hand (15–17).
      * 3♥: maximum hand (18+).
	  * 4♣, 4♦, 4♠: 5-card suit with two of the top three honors.
	  
This treatment is off in competition and as a passed hand.
Unless otherwise stated, 2NT is natural.

2NT: 11-12 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.
	  
#### 3NT
3NT: 13-15 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

#### Splinter Raises
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening, a double jump shows 13+ dummy points,
4+ card support, and shortness in the suit bid (either a singleton or void).
Opener can explore slam by bidding controls or attempt to sign off by bidding game.
For example:

1♠ — 4♣: game forcing, club shortness

   * 4♦, 4♥: slam interest, first round control (usually ace)
   * 4♠: signoff

Responder shows a void by rebidding the splinter suit:

1♠ — 4♣ 

4♥ — 5♣: void

Opener can also self-splinter with a good hand and 4-card support:

1♣ — 1♠

   * 4♦, 4♥: game forcing, shortness

In competition, splinters are off except for jumps in the opponent's suit.

Note: This is the treatment recommended by Richard Pavlicek as described in this [quiz](http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/quiz.pl?5h4100).

### Jump Shifts 
#### Weak Jump Shift
A jump shift in the other major shows a weak hand (less than invitational values) and 6+ cards. Opener must pass without good support.

1♠
   * 3♥: weak

To show an invitational hand in the other major or a minor, bid 1NT and then jump or reverse.

1♠ — 1NT — 2♦
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥: invitational

With a weak hand and a minor, you must pass if you have a singleton or void in opener's suit.
With a doubleton, you can bid 1NT and pass, correct, or sign off in opener's suit.
## Minor Openings 
﻿A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4=4=3=2 shape which should be opened 1♦. 
With 9+ cards in the minors, generally open the longer minor first. 
If the minor is clubs, make sure you have a suitable rebid after partner's response.

### Raises 
Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.
Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better) 
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive). When vulnerable, a jump raise should be 
sound (8-9 dummy points) but when non-vulnerable it is much more wide-ranging.

1♦ - 2♦

   * 2♥, 2♠: stopper
   * 2NT: balanced minimum, side suits stopped
   * 3♦: unbalanced minimum
   * 3NT: 18-19, side suits stopped
   * 4♦: unbalanced maximum (GF, asks for control bids)

Inverted raises are off in all competition.
## One Over One 
A 1/1 bid shows 6+ dummy points and either a 5+ card suit or no lower 4-card suit.
Bid 4-card suits up the line
but with two 5+-card suits bid the highest first.

#### 1♦
A diamond suit is routinely skipped if it is not particularly long or strong.

#### 1NT
1NT shows 7–10 points and denies a four-card major.
It is not forcing, but opener is expected to bid with a strong and/or unbalanced hand.
#### 1NT
1NT: balanced 6–10 points, no four-card major.
It is not forcing, but opener is expected to bid with a strong and/or unbalanced hand.

#### 2NT
2NT: invitational balanced hand (11-12 HCP), no four-card major.

#### 3NT
3NT: game-value balanced hand (13-15 HCP), no four-card major.

#### 4NT
4NT: quantitative balanced hand (16-18 HCP), no four-card major.
### Opener Rebids 
Opener’s rebids are natural and standard.
Unless the hand qualifies for a [Strong Rebid](#strong-rebids), 
make one of the following bids.

   * pass: partner is a passed hand, you have a minimum with 3-card support 
or a sub-minimum with 4-card support
   * 1NT: balanced with 2 or 3-card support for partner, 
or unbalanced with a stiff A or K in partner's suit and no other alternative
   * rebid suit: 6-cards or strong 5
   * new suit (non-reverse): 4-cards
   * raise to 2: minimum, usually 4-cards, though good 3-card support is acceptable if notrump is not
   * jump raise: invitational, 17-18 dummy points
   * 3NT: to play, usually long running minor
   * double jump shift: game force, splinter
   * jump to game: 18-19 balanced

### Responder Rebids 
If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

#### Sign-off
Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

1♦ — 1♠;

2♣

   * Pass
   * 2♦ = 2-3 hearts, likely misfit
   * 2♠ = 6+ spades

There is one exception to the rule that new suits are forcing:

1♦ — 1♠;

1NT

   * 2♥ = sign-off - opener must pass or correct (bust with 5-4 or better distribution)
   
#### Inviting Game
Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, jump in a bid suit, new minor:

1♦ — 1♠;

2♣ — 2NT, 3♣, 3♦, 3♠ = 11–12 points, inviting game.

#### Forcing to Game
Bids available for forcing to game:
   * Fourth suit
   * Jump or reverse in new suit
   * New Minor Forcing followed by a rebid of previously bid suit
      * For example, 1♣-1♠;1NT-2♦;2♥-2♠ shows a game-forcing hand and a 6-card suit

Opener can sign off in game or make a slam try. 
4NT is Blackwood (see topic) only if suit agreement has been established. 
Otherwise it is quantitative, asking responder to proceed with a maximum. 
Suit bids usually show controls.

#### Signing off at Game
Any bid of game is a sign-off, though partner can proceed with a maximum (see Slam Bidding).

#### New Minor Forcing
A new minor suit at the responder's second bid or later is forcing for one round and thus
is invitational at the 2-level and game forcing at the 3-level.
When more than one minor is available (1♥-1♠;1NT-2m), 
it tends to show a stopper for NT.

1♣ — 1♠

1NT (or 2♣) — 2♦ (forcing)

After New Minor Forcing, opener must describe his hand further.
* 2 of responder's suit: 3-card support, minimum
* 3 of responder's suit: 3-card support, extras (preacceptance)
* 2 of other major: 4 cards, minimum
* 3 of other major: 4 cards, extras (preacceptance)
* 2NT: minimum
* 3NT: to play (maximum)

If opener has rebid 1NT, 
rebids should be designed to find a suit contract.
* raise new minor: extras, stopper, forcing to 3NT or higher

If opener has rebid his suit, 
rebids should be designed to find a 3NT contract
* raise other minor: 4-cards, extras
* rebid opener's suit: retreat (minimum, no stopper in new minor)

## Two Over One 
By an unpassed hand, a two-over-one response shows 13+ points and 4+ cards 
or exactly 3 of opener's major. 
It is forcing to game.

2♥ over 1♠ shows 5+ cards.

2♣ over 1♦ shows 5+ cards and does not deny a 4-card major.

#### Opener's Rebids
Opener responds naturally to clarify the hand.

   * 2NT - balanced minimum or maximum and suitable for declaring NT
   * 3NT - intermediate hand (15-17)
   * Any other suit - 4+ cards (reverse implies extra strength)
   * Jump shift - splinter support of previously bid suit
   * Rebid of original suit - no better response

## Strong Rebids 
### Jump Rebid
After an opening at the 1-level and nearly any response by partner, a jump rebid shows at least 16 total points and a good six card suit.
The suit should be strong enough to play opposite a small singleton. Responses:
* pass: bad fit, bad hand
* 3NT or raise to game: to play
* Other suit: cue bid in support of opener's suit
* 4NT: Blackwood

### Jump to Game
After a 1-level bid and any response by partner, 
a direct jump to game shows a one-suited hand 
that is too strong to preempt and too weak to jump rebid, reverse, or jump-shift.
Responder is expected to pass without support and/or excellent controls.
### Reverses
After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit.
It is forcing for one round. 
Responder has two weak responses:
   * A rebid at the two-level shows 5+ cards in the suit
   * 2NT denies 5+ cards

Both of these responses are forcing for one round. 
Without good support, opener will usually retreat to the first suit.
The exception is when there is another unbid four-card suit (e.g., 5-0-4-4 distribution).

All other bids by responder are natural and forcing to game. 
### Opener Jump to 2NT
Opener's jump to 2NT shows a stronger-than-1NT opening (18-19 HCP).
Responder's rebids are mostly natural.

#### 1m - 1M; 2NT...

   * pass: weak hand, 4-card suit
   * rebid suit: weak hand (signoff), 5+card suit
   * retreat to opener's minor: weak hand (signoff), 4-card major,
   5+ cards in opener's suit (or 4-4-4-1 distribution)
   * new minor: 5 card suit and/or unbid four card major, game-forcing
   * 3♥: 5-5 or better, game-forcing or better
   (if 6-5 then looking to signoff at game)
   * 3NT/4NT/6NT: natural, 4-card suit
   * 4♣: Gerber
   * 3♠, 4♦, 4♥: 6-5 distribution or better, slam interest
   * raise to 4: 6+ cards, signoff

#### 1♣ - 1♦; 2NT...
Same as the above with the following addition:
   * 3♥, 3♠: 4-card major, game-forcing

### Opener Jump Shift
After a 1/1 or 1NT/1 bid, a jump shift shows 19+ total points and an unbalanced hand. 
Usually it shows 5+ cards in the first suit and 4+ in the second suit, 
although it can also show 6-3-3-1 or 4-4-4-1 distribution if the second suit is a minor.
It is forcing to game. 

Responses:
* A rebid at the two-level: 5+ cards in the suit
* 3NT: denies support, extra length, or shape
* new suit: natural, extras, often a first round control
* support of either suit below game: sets trumps and shows extra shape; responder rebids:
   * Suit: first round control
   * Exception: return to first suit (major only): 6-3-3-1 distribution (warning responder from a 4-3 fit)
   * Jump new suit: splinter
* game in either suit: signoff

## Strong 2♣ 
﻿A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points balanced, 8 1/2+ tricks in a major, or 9 1/2+ tricks in a minor.

Responses:

2♣
   * 2♦: conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response.
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural and game forcing with a minimum of 8 HCP and
a five-card suit with two of the top three honors.
   * 2NT: 8+ HCP, balanced.

After a 2♦ response, opener rebids naturally:
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural, forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor
   * 2NT: 22-24 points (see responses for 2NT opening above)
   * 3NT: 28+ points (see responses for 3NT opening above)

In response to a suit rebid, responder indicates strength.

2♣ — 2♦

2♥
   * 2♠, 3♦: natural, game force
   * 3♣: artificial (cheaper minor), very weak (0-4, not an ace)
   * 3NT: 5-7 points, at best a low doubleton
   * 3♥: positive, slam invitational
   * 4♥: sign-off

2♣ — 2♦

3♦:
   * 3♥: "cheaper minor" (instead of 4♣)
   * others: same as above

### Over Interference
The 2♣ opening automatically creates a forcing auction.
All bids are natural and positive, all doubles are for penalty, and all passes are forcing.
## Weak Two Bids of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ 
A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. On rare
occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. It is possible to open a weak two with
a poor seven-card suit (not good enough to open with at the three level). 

Responses:

A 2NT response is forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) Opener rebids his suit with a
minimum weak two (5–8 points). With a maximum hand opener bids another
suit to show a “feature” (ace or king in that suit); 
with a solid suit (AKJxxx or better) he raises to 3NT.

Any raise of opener’s suit is to play and could be preemptive. 

A 3NT response is also to play.

“RONF” on the card means “Raise Only Non-Force.” A new-suit response is forcing
one round and shows at least a five-card suit. Opener should raise a major suit
response with a three-card fit, or perhaps with a doubleton honor.

With no fit for responder’s suit, opener rebids:
   * With a minimum weak two-bid (5–8 points), rebid the suit at the lowest level.
   * With a maximum weak two-bid, name a new suit or bid notrump.
   
## Slam Bidding 
### Roman Key-Card Blackwood 1430
Once suit agreement has been reached, 4NT is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump.

   * 5♣ = 1 or 4 keycards
   * 5♦ = 3 or 0 keycards
   * 5♥ = 2 keycards, no queen of trump
   * 5♠ = 2 keycards, queen of trump

After a 5♣ or 5♦ response, the Blackwood initiator may ask for the queen of trump
(or extra trump length) by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement) - 4NT - 5♣ - 5♦ = Queen ask
      * 5♥ = no queen
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦ = queen, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 5NT = queen, no kings

#### With (Useful) Voids
After 4NT, responder can show voids with at least one keycard:
   * 5NT = even number of keycards (never zero)
   * 6 of void suit = odd number of keycards
   * 6 of trump suit = odd number of keycards, void is in higher suit

#### 5NT
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.

### Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over any 1NT OR 2NT by partner, including a rebid of
1NT OR 2NT. Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦: 0 aces
   * 4♥: 1 ace
   * 4♠: 2 aces
   * 4NT: 3 aces

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦: 0 or 4 kings
   * 5♥: 1 king
   * 5♠: 2 kings
   * 5NT: 3 kings

### 5NT Pick a Slam
A voluntary bid of 5NT is forcing and asks partner to try to pick the best slam available.
There are no hard-and-fast rules here, but possibilities include:
   * bidding a new 4-card suit (looking for a 4-4 fit)
   * supporting partner with mild support (looking for a good 7-card fit)
   * rebidding a previously bid suit with unannounced length and/or strength
   * returning to 6NT with no better options

The asker may continue to bid up the line if completely displeased with the response.

## Defensive Bidding 
### Doubles
A double is for takeout over a partscore bid (4♦ or lower). 
In the direct position over a 1-level bid, it shows about 13+ total points and support for the unbid suits or 18+ points and any distribution. 
In the balancing position it can be 2-3 points lighter.

Advancer is expected to bid after a takeout double. 
The Rule of 9 (#cards + #honors + bid level >= 9) is a reasonable guideline to determine when to convert the double to penalty.
With insufficient strength and no compelling suit, a 1NT bid is permissible. 
Unlike in other bidding situations, bid four-card suits highest first. 
In some cases this will allow you to show your second suit and give partner a choice of places to play. 

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational (9-12 declarer points). 
To force for one round, responder cuebids opener’s suit. 
This is forcing to game by an unpassed hand.

Any subsequent bid by doubler shows significant extras and is strongly invitational to game. 
If advancer has jumped, then a new suit or NT bid by doubler is forcing to game.

Over opening game bids (4♥ or higher), a double is for penalty.
However, advancer may pull the double with undisclosed distribution and/or poor defensive values.
### Responsive Doubles
After an opponent bids at the one level, partner doubles for takeout,
and the other opponent raises, a double by advancer is responsive. 
This allows the original doubler to be declarer and to pick the preferred suit.

Responsive Doubles are on through 4♦ but off after a preemptive opening.
### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 8–16 points (double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural. 

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid two suits is natural in either suit.

### NT Overcalls
With appropriate strength and a stopper in the opponent's suit,
you may make a NT overcall.
All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

#### Direct Position (1X-?)
   * 10-14 HCP: pass or double then pass
   * 15-18 HCP: 1NT
   * 19-21 HCP: double then bid NT
   * 22-24 HCP: double then jump NT
   
#### Balancing Position (1X-p-p-?)
   * 12-15 HCP: 1NT
   * 16-18 HCP: double then bid NT
   * 19-21 HCP: double then jump in NT
   * 22-24 HCP: 3NT
   * 2NT is unusual (see below)

#### 2-Level (2X-? or 1X-p-2X-?)
   * 15-18 HCP: 2NT
   * 19-21 HCP: 3NT
   * 22-24 HCP: double then 3NT
      
#### 3-Level (3X-? or any-p-3X-?)
   * 15-18 HCP: pass or 3NT
   * 19-24 HCP: 3NT

### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
(It may show 4-5-2-2 distribution but in that case it should be a king stronger.)

(1♦) - 2NT = hearts and clubs

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.

Note: Unusual 2NT may be off in the reopening seat (see NT Overcalls above).

### Unusual 4NT
In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Over an opening 4♠ bid, 4NT is takeout.
### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

   * If the opening is in a minor suit, the cuebid shows the majors; 
   * If the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.
When vulnerable, it is best to avoid very weak hands. 
(This also makes it easier for advancer to decide to bid game.)
When non-vulnerable, the low-end range is much wider. 

#### Responses to a Minor Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
1. 2NT: Invitational
1. Opponent's suit: Game or slam try

#### Responses to a Major Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
2. Jump in major: Weak if below game
1. 2NT: asks for overcaller’s minor.
   * If advancer then returns to the major, this is invitational.
   * If there is further interference, 4NT may also ask for the minor.

#### Rare Responses to Either Cuebid

2. Jump in major: Good support, but weak if below game
1. Unbid minor (no further interference): Weak
1. 3NT: To play

#### Overcaller Rebids
Overcaller will normally have a weak hand and will pass or make a minimum response. 
With a strong hand or freakier distribution, overcaller will make some other bid.
### After Opponents Bid Two Suits
After the opponents show two suits, it is often prudent to show the other two suits.

* Double: 4+ cards in each unbid suit and/or extra strength
* Cheapest unbid suit: Standard overcall; Continuations by overcaller:
   * Pass: Minimum
   * Fourth suit (if first suit is not supported): Opening strength, two-suited
   * Fourth suit (if first suit is supported): More than opening strength, game try
* Lower bid suit: Michaels (5-5 distribution expected)
* Higher bid suit: Natural
* 2NT: 5-5 or more in the two unbid suits, preemptive

### Meckwell vs. Strong 1NT
Meckwell features multiple ways to show single-suited or 5-4 hands.  
   * double: long minor or both majors or 18+ HCP 
   * 2♣: clubs and a major
   * 2♦: diamonds and a major
   * 2♥: natural, rebiddable
   * 2♠: natural, rebiddable
   * 2NT: minors

After double, Advancer is expected to relay to 2♣. 
Responses to 2♣:
   * pass: single-suited with clubs
   * 2♦: single-suited with diamonds
   * 2♥: both majors
   * 2♠: both majors, but spades are stronger
   * 3♣: natural, rebiddable

After 2♣ or 2♦, Advancer may pass or bid 2♥. 
Overcaller may pass or correct to 2♠.
### Cappelletti vs. 1NT
#### Unpassed Hand
Cappelletti (AKA Hamilton) is a common defense to 1NT (especially weak). Unpassed hand responses:
   * double: penalty 
   * 2♣: single-suited
      * pass: 6 clubs
	  * 2♦: relay (pass or correct)
	     * 2NT: 4 diamonds, 6 clubs
	  * 2♥/2♠: 5-card suit, weak
	  * 2NT: Invitational (11+), balanced
   * 2♦: majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
      * Pass: 6 diamonds
      * 2♥/2♠: Unconstructive preference
      * 2NT: Minors
      * 3♣: 6 clubs
	  * Raise to 3: Invitational
   * 2♥/2♠: that major and a minor
      * pass: Fit, unconstructive
      * 2NT: Asking for minor
	     * Responder may return to major to show 10-12
      * Raise to 3: Invitational 8-9
   * 2NT: Minors (5-5 or better)
      * 3♣/3♦: Unconstructive preference
	  * 3♥/3♠: six cards, no interest in minors
	  * 4♣/4♦: Invitational
	  
#### Passed Hand
By a passed hand, the system changes slightly:
   * double: clubs or red suits (pass or correct)

### Overcalls of Strong Openings
Against any strong opening (usually 2♣ or 1♣), 
an overcall is a transfer to the next higher suit.

## Preemptive Bids
Opening suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and based on playing tricks
(the number of tricks you expect to take if your long suit is trumps).
Overbid based on the rule of 2-3-4:
   * vulnerable vs. nonvulnerable: overbid by 2 tricks
   * equal vulnerability: overbid by 3 tricks
   * nonvulnerable vs. vulnerable: overbid by 4 tricks

Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:
   * more than one outside trick
   * a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better
   * a void in a minor

Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.
## Competitive Bidding 
It is sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠943 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣Q3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

### New Suits
In a competitive sequence, new suits by an unpassed hand are forcing.
(To make a constructive, non-forcing bid, consider a Negative Double.)
New suits by a passed hand are constructive but non-forcing.

Jump shifts are weak, showing a similar hand to a preempt.

### Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows a limit raise or better:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = limit raise or better.

Note: If playing inverted minors ON in competition, then that treatment supercedes this one.

### Jump Raise
When using this treatment, a jump raise is weak / competitive.

1♠ - (2♣) - 3♠ = weak, 4+ card support

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+  

### With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

#### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (11-12 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

### Against Conventions
After partner opens in a suit and a conventional bid by the opponents shows one known suit, 
a cue bid shows a good raise, a double shows a good hand without support, and other bids are weak. 
For example:

1♠ — (2♠:Michaels) 
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: weak
   * 3♥: Limit raise or better in spades.
   * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

If the conventional bid shows two known suits, 
there are two cue bids available and the second shows the fourth suit. 
For example:

1♣ — (2NT:Unusual) 
   * 3♣, 3♠: weak
   * 3♦: Limit raise or better in clubs.
   * 3♥: 10+HCP, 5+ spades
   * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

### Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double:

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * 2NT = limit raise (at least 10 points) — or better.
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, but it is better to make a more
descriptive bid of 1♥, 1♠, or 2NT with the appropriate hand.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

A responder’s jump shift after a double is to play:

1♦ — (Double) — 2♥, 2♠, 3♣ = six-plus card suit, like a weak two-bid or
preemptive three-bid.
### Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major. 
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level. 
With insufficient high-card strength for a free bid, double may also be used with a five-card or longer suit.

   * 1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.
   * 1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).
   * 1♦ — (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–6 points.
   * 1♠ — (4♦) — Double = four hearts and 10+ points or five hearts and 8-10 points.

If both majors are bid, then a double shows both minors.
   * 1♥ — (1♠) — Double = 4-4 or better in the minors.

When the opponents overcall a minor over a minor at the two-level or higher, 
a double shows at least one four-card major 
and at least two places to play.

   * 1♦ — (2♣) — Double = at least one four-card major.
   * 1♣ — (2♦) — Double = at least one four-card major.

If opener bids the a major you cannot support, 
rebid opener's first suit or NT to imply the other major.

### Card-Showing Doubles
In a competitive auction below game, a double is card-showing. 
Partner is requested to do something intelligent, such as:
  * Show secondary support for a previously bid suit
  * Rebid an extra-long or extra-strong suit
  * Bid a previously unbid four-card suit
  * Bid NT with at least one good stopper
  * Convert to penalty (usually with a decent four cards)

### Penalty Doubles
A double is unequivocally for penalty in the following cases:
  * After a game contract by the opponents
  * After a natural NT bid by any player
  * After a pass
  * After two previous doubles by either partner
  * After partner has bid or doubled over an opposing preempt and preempter's partner has raised

#### Lightner Doubles
A double of a NT or slam contract is Lightner, asking for a specific lead such as:
  * dummy's first bid suit
  * a suit doubler has not shown

#### Lead-Directing Doubles
In fourth position or after a pass, double of an artificial bid is lead-directing. 
To make the bid, doubler must be confident that:
   * the lead will be helpful
   * the opponents will not be able to make the contract redoubled

### Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.

## Defensive Leads and Signals 
#### Carding
First discard is attitude for that suit. (See "Signals" below.)
#### Leads
Leads are: 
* top of touching honors and interior sequences.
* A from A–K–x-(x...)
   * Q from partner either is singleton or promises J
* K from A-K tight or A-K-J-(x)
* Top of all doubletons (including honors)
* 2nd best from x-x-x-x or x-x-x-x-x
* 4th best from H-x-x-x or H-x-x-x-x
* Bottom from H-x-x, top from x–x–x (BOSTON)

#### Signals (Upside-Down Count and Attitude)
   1. Attitude (low encourages)
   1. Count (low = even)
   1. Suit preference (high = higher suit)

A jack is an encouraging card, more than a 2.


This branch contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes the bridge system
used by Jeff Yutzler and Rick Bingham. 
It is a 2 over 1 game force (no exceptions) with other commonly used conventions.
It is suitable for advancing club players.

## General Approach 
Two-over-one game forcing with five-card majors

Strong forcing opening: 2♣;
## Notrump Opening Bids 
Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is particularly strong. 
Semi-balanced hands with either 5-4-2-2 or 6-3-2-2 distribution 
may be treated as balanced if the doubletons are Qx or better. 

A hand may be upgraded 1 point for a long suit with good texture (e.g., QJT9x)
and downgraded 1 point for a 4-3-3-3 hand with poor texture (e.g., AJx-KJx-Axx-Qxxx).

The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:

   * 12-14: Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT
   * 15-17: Open 1NT
   * 18-19: Open 1 of a suit, jump NT
   * 20-21: Open 2NT
   * 22-24: Open 2♣, rebid NT
   * 25-27: Open 3NT
   * 28+: Open 2♣, jump NT

### 1NT 15-17 
#### Basic Responses
   * 2♣: Stayman (also for invitational hands)
   * 3NT: sign-off
   * 4♣: Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * 4NT: natural, quantitative invite to 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit (Garbage Stayman).
Usually responder will have 8+ HCPs (assuming a 15-17 1NT range).

Opener rebids:

   * 2♦: no four-card major
   * 2♥: four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠: five spades (possibly with four hearts) or four spades

Responder's rebids after 2♥ or 2♠:
   * 2♠ (over 2♥): four spades, denies four hearts
   * 3♠ (over 2♥) or 3♥ (over 2♠): forcing raise, slam interest, requests cue bid
   * 3 of that major: invitational
   * 4 of that major: signoff

Responder's rebids after any response:
   * 2NT: invitational, not necessarily with an unbid major
   * 3♣, 3♦: five cards, slam interest
   * 3NT: signoff with an unbid major (choice of games)
   * 4♣: Gerber (key card if over a major)
   * 4♦, 4♥ (over 2♠): unused
   * 4NT: quantitative

#### 3♣ Puppet Stayman
3♣ is a game-forcing artificial bid that is designed to find both 5-3 and 4-4 fits.
It is on over 1NT and 2NT openings.

Opener rebids:
   * 3♦: no five-card major and at least one four-card major
   * 3♥ or 3♠: five of that major
   * 3NT: no four-card or five-card major

After 3♦:
   * 3♥ or 3♠: four of the other major
   * 3NT: signoff
   * 4♦: 4 of both majors
   * 4 of that major: signoff - usually six cards and three of the other major

After 3 of a major:
   * 4 of that major: signoff
   * The other major: Good hand, requests cue bids

After any response:
   * 3NT: signoff
   * 4♣: Gerber (key card if over a major)
   * 4NT: quantitative

#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major.
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦: transfer to hearts
   * 2♥: transfer to spades

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥: normal acceptance of the transfer
   * 3♥: 17 points and four-card heart support

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit,
that is natural and game forcing.
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥; 2♠
   * Pass: content to play 2♠
   * 2NT: invitational with a five-card suit
      * Pass or 3♠: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * 3♣, 3♦: natural (4+), slam interest
   * 3NT: asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠
   * 4NT: quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit
   * 5NT: Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors)
   * 6♠: pick a slam (pass or correct)

#### Single-suited Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major.
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):

   * 4♦: transfer to hearts
   * 4♥: transfer to spades

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer,
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents.
The following shows how they are used with strong NT (15-17) openings.

   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Invitational with a six-card suit (would make a 1 over 1 bid): Jacoby, raise to 3; Opener rebids:
      * pass: minimum
      * 3NT (rare - usually requires three cards and a balanced hand) or 4M: maximum
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Two options:
      * Jacoby, raise to 4 in suit (balanced)
      * Jacoby, jump in another suit (splinter)
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Two options:
      * Texas, 4NT (Blackwood) OR 
      * Jacoby, other major (requests cue bids)
   * Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors): Texas, 5NT

It is rare, but a direct bid of 4♠ or 6♠ is to play and is only used when your hand is not amenable to transferring (for example, an unprotected king).

#### 2-level:
A transfer at the 2-level is used with certain hands with the majors.
   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass: bust
   * 2♦(transfer) followed by 2♠: 6 hearts, slam try (request to cue bid)
   * 2♥(transfer) followed by 3♥: 6 spades, slam try (request to cue bid)

#### 3-level: 5-5 hands
The 3-level is used to show most 5-5 hands.

   * 3♦: 5-5 minors, game forcing
   * 3♥: 5-5 majors, invitational
   * 3♠: 5-5 majors, choice of games

#### 4-level
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

#### Smolen 5-4 or better in the Majors
If responder is weak, transfer to the five-card major and pass.
Otherwise use a Stayman to show 5-4 in the majors as follows:

1NT — 2♣; 2♦
   * pass: weak (5-4=4=0 distribution)
   * 2♥ or 2♠: that major, invitational
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Over 2NT, a similar system applies but there are no invitational bids:

2NT — 3♣; 3♦
   * pass: weak  (5-4=4=0 distribution)
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Smolen does not apply over 3NT.

#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor.

   * 2♠ = transfer to clubs
      * 2NT: preacceptance (good support)
      * 3♣: normal response
   * 2NT = transfer to diamonds
      * 3♦: normal response
      * 3♣: preacceptance (good support)

#### Over Interference
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

1NT — (Double) — 2♣ = Stayman

1NT — (Double) — 2♦ = transfer to hearts

With a bad hand and a weak minor, redouble for SOS.

1NT — (Double) — Redouble = Rescue - weak with a long minor (opener bids 2♣, pass or correct).

Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents at the 2-level is for penalty.

Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents at the 3-level or higher is for negative, promising at least one major.

Jacoby Transfers are on over 2♣.

Double of an artificial 2♣ = Stayman, does not imply invitational or better values. 

Cue bid of opponent's natural suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥ = Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts

Suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.

   * 2♥, 2♠ = To play, 5+.
   * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.

The Texas transfer is on through 3♣. In other words it must be a jump.

### 2NT and 3NT 
 Stayman and Jacoby transfers for the majors are used.

#### 2NT 20-21
   * 3♣: Puppet Stayman
   * 3♦, 3♥: Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively
   * 4♣: Gerber (ace asking)
   * 4NT: Quantitative for 6NT
   * 5NT: Quantitative for 7NT

#### 3NT 25-27
   * 4♣: Stayman
   * 4♦, 4♥: Jacoby transfers to hearts and spades, respectively
   * 4NT: Quantitative for 6NT
   * 5NT: Quantitative for 7NT

## Major Openings 
Normally open five-card majors in all seats.

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.
### NT Responses 
#### 1NT Forcing
1NT typically shows 6–12 points and is used in a number of circumstances:
   * No support for the major opened
   * A three-card limit raise
   * A bust hand with otherwise good trump support (too weak for a direct raise)

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

It is 100% forcing by an unpassed hand so responder must be prepared for a three-card response or a rebid with only five cards.

Responder can sign off or invite game with the rebid
   * other 2-level bid: weak hand, sign-off (opener may raise 1♠-1NT;2m-2♥ with 5=4-0-4 distribution and a good hand)
   * 2 of major: sign-off
   * 2♠ after 1♥-1NT;2m: good support of minor (impossible spade)
   * single raise of minor: good support (could be weak especially if 2♠ is available)
   * 2NT: balanced invite (11-12)
   * 3♥ after 1♠-1NT;2♥: invitational
   * 3X: invitational (usually a 6-card suit)
   * 3 of major: three-card limit raise

### Raises 
The following assumes a 1♥ opening but the system over 1♠ is similar. 
#### General
   * 2♥ = three-card support, 7–10 dummy points (strong enough to accept at least one game try).
   * 4♥ = usually five+ cards, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

#### Bergen Raises
   * 3♣ = mixed raise (7-10 dummy points with four or more hearts).
      * 3♦ = game try
   * 3♦ = limit raise (11–12 dummy points with four or more hearts).
   * 3♥ = weak raise (6 or fewer dummy points with four or more hearts).

#### Passed Hands
Bergen Raises are off. See Drury section if applicable.

#### In Competition
Bergen Raises are off in competition.
#### Jacoby 2NT
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening:

   * 2NT = Game-forcing raise (13+ dummy points, 4+ trumps, all hand patterns). 
Asks opener to describe his hand to help responder evaluate slam prospects.

      * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠ = singleton or void in that suit.
      * 4♥ = minimum hand.
      * 3NT = medium hand (15–17).
      * 3♥ = maximum hand (18+).
	  * 4♣, 4♦, 4♠ = 5-card suit with two of the top three honors.
	  
This treatment is off in competition and as a passed hand.
Unless otherwise stated, 2NT is natural.

2NT = 11-12 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.
	  
#### 3NT
3NT = 13-15 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

#### Splinter Raises
Over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening, a double jump shows 13+ dummy points,
4+ card support, and shortness in the suit bid (either a singleton or void).
Opener can explore slam by bidding controls or attempt to sign off by bidding game.
For example:

1♠ — 4♣ = game forcing, club shortness

   * 4♦, 4♥ = slam interest, first round control (usually ace)
   * 4♠ = signoff

Responder shows a void by rebidding the splinter suit:

1♠ — 4♣ 

4♥ — 5♣ = void

Opener can also splinter with a good hand and 4-card support:

1♣ — 1♠

   * 4♦, 4♥ = game forcing, shortness

In competition, splinters are off except for jumps in the opponent's suit.

Note: This is the treatment recommended by Richard Pavlicek as described in this [quiz](http://www.rpbridge.net/cgi-bin/quiz.pl?5h4100).

#### Bromad Raises
The following raises are made after a double.
   * 2♣: constructive raise (7-10 dummy points with three hearts).
      * 2♦: game try
   * 2♦: limit raise (11-12 dummy points with three hearts).
   * 2♥: weak raise (6 or fewer dummy points with three hearts).
   * 3♣: mixed raise (7-10 dummy points with four or more hearts).
      * 3♦: game try
   * 3♦: limit raise (11–12 dummy points with four or more hearts).
   * 3♥: weak raise (6 or fewer dummy points with four or more hearts).
   * 4♥: usually five+ cards, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

#### Other Bids after a Takeout Double
   * Redouble: game-forcing raise or 10+HCP without support
   * 2NT: weak with one long minor (opener bids 3♣, pass or correct)

#### Passed hands
Bromad raises are on as a passed hand. 

### Jump Shifts 
#### Weak Jump Shift
A jump shift in the other major shows a weak hand (less than invitational values) and 6+ cards. Opener must pass without good support.

1♠
   * 3♥: weak

To show an invitational hand in the other major or a minor, bid 1NT and then jump or reverse.

1♠ — 1NT — 2♦
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥: invitational

With a weak hand and a minor, you must pass if you have a singleton or void in opener's suit.
With a doubleton, you can bid 1NT and pass, correct, or sign off in opener's suit.
## Minor Openings 
﻿A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4–4–3–2 shape: 
four spades, four hearts, three diamonds, and two clubs, which should
be opened 1♦.

### Raises 
Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.
Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better) 
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive). When vulnerable, a jump raise should be 
sound (8-9 dummy points) but when non-vulnerable it is much more wide-ranging.

1♦ - 2♦

   * 2♥, 2♠: stopper
   * 2NT: balanced minimum, side suits stopped
   * 3♦: unbalanced minimum
   * 3NT: 18-19, side suits stopped

Inverted raises are off in all competition.
## One Over One 
A 1/1 bid shows 6+ dummy points and either a 5+ card suit or no lower 4-card suit.
Bid 4-card suits up the line
but with two 5+-card suits bid the highest first.

#### 1♦
A 1♦ response to 1♣ shows one of the following hand types:
   * Rebiddable diamonds
   * A game force with at least one major
   * A balanced 6-8 points and a desire for opener to declare 1NT.

A diamond suit is automatically skipped in favor of a major 
unless the hand is strong enough to force to game. 
#### 1NT
1NT over 1♣ shows a balanced 8–10 HCP and denies a four-card major. 
Over 1♦ the range is wider (6-10 HCP).
It is not forcing, but opener is expected to bid with a strong and/or unbalanced hand.

#### 2NT
2NT is invitational - 11-12 HCP, no four-card major, balanced hand.

#### 3NT
3NT shows game-values - 13-15 HCP, no four-card major, balanced hand.

#### 4NT
4NT is quantitative - 16-18 HCP, no four-card major, balanced hand.
### Opener's jump to 2NT
Opener's jump to 2NT shows a stronger-than-1NT opening (18-19 HCP).
Responder's rebids are mostly natural.

#### 1m - 1M; 2NT...

   * pass: weak hand, 4-card suit
   * rebid suit: weak hand (signoff), 5+card suit
   * retreat to opener's minor: weak hand (signoff), 4-card major,
   5+ cards in opener's suit (or 4-4-4-1 distribution)
   * new minor: 5 card suit and/or unbid four card major, game-forcing
   * 3♥: 5-5 or better, game-forcing or better
   (if 6-5 then looking to signoff at game)
   * 3NT/4NT/6NT: natural, 4-card suit
   * 4♣: Gerber
   * 3♠, 4♦, 4♥: 6-5 distribution or better, slam interest
   * raise to 4: 6+ cards, signoff

#### 1♣ - 1♦; 2NT...
Same as the above with the following addition:
   * 3♥, 3♠: 4-card major, game-forcing

### Opener Rebids 
Opener’s rebids are natural and standard.

#### Rebids with a minimum hand (13–16 points)
   * Rebidding notrump at the lowest available level;
   * Raising responder’s suit at the lowest level (usually four cards, though good three-card support is acceptable if notrump is not);
   * Rebidding a new suit at the one level or rebidding a new suit at the two level that
is lower ranking than the opening suit (not reversing);
   * Rebidding opener’s suit at the lowest level.

#### Rebids with a medium hand (17–18 points)
   * Jump raise or jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Reverse in a new suit, i.e., bid a new suit at the two level which is higher ranking
than the opening suit;
   * Non-reverse bid in a new suit (this has the wide range of 13–18 points)

#### With a maximum hand (19–21 or 22 points) opener must make a very strong rebid:
   * Jump in notrump;
   * Double jump raise of responder’s suit or double jump rebid of opener’s suit;
   * Jump shift or reverse in a new suit.

Responder follows up by attempting to sign off in game, bidding 4NT
Blackwood, or cuebidding if still interested in trying to cooperate with opener
in making the slam decision.

### Responder Rebids 
If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

#### Sign-off
Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

1♥ — 1♠;

2♣

   * Pass
   * 2♥ = 2-3 hearts, likely misfit
   * 2♠ = 6+ spades

There is one exception to the rule that new suits are forcing:

1♣ — 1♠;

1NT

   * 2♥ = sign-off - opener must pass or correct (bust with 5-5 or 5-4 distribution)
   
#### Inviting Game
Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, 3 of opener's suit, new minor, jump rebid of major:

1♥ — 1♠;

2♣ — 2NT, 3♣, 3♥ = 11–12 points, inviting game.

In addition, a new minor suit at the responder's second bid or later is forcing for one round and thus
is invitational at the 2-level and game forcing at the 3-level.

1♥ — 1♠;

1NT (or 2♣)

   * 2♦: New Minor Forcing

Opener is encouraged to show secondary support for responder's suit
or bid an unbid 4-card major if possible. 
When more than one minor is available, it tends to show a stopper for NT.

#### Forcing to Game
Bids available for forcing to game:
   * Fourth suit
   * Jump or reverse in new suit
   * New Minor Forcing followed by a rebid of previously bid suit
      * For example, 1♣-1♠;1NT-2♦;2♥-2♠ shows a game-forcing hand and a 6-card suit

Opener can sign off in game or make a slam try. 
4NT is Blackwood (see topic) only if suit agreement has been established. 
Otherwise it is quantitative, asking responder to proceed with a maximum. 
Suit bids usually show controls.

#### Signing off at Game
Any bid of game is a sign-off, though partner can proceed with a maximum (see Slam Bidding).

## Two Over One 
By an unpassed hand, a two-over-one response shows 13+ points and 4+ cards 
or exactly 3 of opener's major. 
It is forcing to game.

2♥ over 1♠ shows 5+ cards.

2♣ over 1♦ shows 5+ cards and does not deny a 4-card major.

#### Opener's Rebids
Opener responds naturally to clarify the hand.

   * 2NT - balanced minimum or maximum and suitable for declaring NT
   * 3NT - intermediate hand (15-17)
   * Any other suit - 4+ cards (reverse implies extra strength)
   * Jump shift - splinter support of previously bid suit
   * Rebid of original suit - no better response

## Strong 2♣ 
﻿A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points balanced, 8 1/2+ tricks in a major, or 9 1/2+ tricks in a minor.

Responses:

2♣
   * 2♦: conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response.
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural and game forcing with a minimum of 8 HCP and
a five-card suit with two of the top three honors.
   * 2NT: 8+ HCP, balanced.

After a 2♦ response, opener rebids naturally:
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural, forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor
   * 2NT: 22-24 points (see responses for 2NT opening above)
   * 3NT: 28+ points (see responses for 3NT opening above)

In response to a suit rebid, responder indicates strength.

2♣ — 2♦

2♥
   * 2♠, 3♦: natural, game force
   * 3♣: artificial (cheaper minor), very weak (0-4, not an ace)
   * 3NT: 5-7 points, at best a low doubleton
   * 3♥: positive, slam invitational
   * 4♥: sign-off

2♣ — 2♦

3♦:
   * 3♥: "cheaper minor" (instead of 4♣)
   * others: same as above

### Over Interference
The 2♣ opening automatically creates a forcing auction.
All bids are natural and positive, all doubles are for penalty, and all passes are forcing.
## Weak Two Bids of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ 
A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. On rare
occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. It is possible to open a weak two with
a poor seven-card suit (not good enough to open with at the three level). 

Responses:

A 2NT response is forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) Opener rebids his suit with a
minimum weak two (5–8 points). With a maximum hand opener bids another
suit to show a “feature” (ace or king in that suit); 
with a solid suit (AKJxxx or better) he raises to 3NT.

Any raise of opener’s suit is to play and could be preemptive. 

A 3NT response is also to play.

“RONF” on the card means “Raise Only Non-Force.” A new-suit response is forcing
one round and shows at least a five-card suit. Opener should raise a major suit
response with a three-card fit, or perhaps with a doubleton honor.

With no fit for responder’s suit, opener rebids:
   * With a minimum weak two-bid (5–8 points), rebid the suit at the lowest level.
   * With a maximum weak two-bid, name a new suit or bid notrump.
   
## Slam Bidding 
### Roman Key-Card Blackwood 0314
Once suit agreement has been reached, 4NT is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump. 

4NT KC Asking:
   * 5♣ = 0 or 3 keycards
   * 5♦ = 1 or 4 keycards
   * 5♥ = 2 keycards, no queen of trump
   * 5♠ = 2 keycards, queen of trump

After a 5♣ or 5♦ response, the Blackwood initiator may ask for the queen of trump
(or extra trump length) by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement) - 4NT - 5♣ - 5♦ = Queen ask
      * 5♥ = no queen
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦ = queen, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 5NT = queen, no kings

#### With (Useful) Voids
After 4NT, responder can show voids with at least one keycard:
   * 5NT = even number of keycards (never zero)
   * 6 of void suit = odd number of keycards
   * 6 of trump suit = odd number of keycards, void is in higher suit

#### 5NT
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.

### Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over first or last NT. 
Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a plain Blackwood 4NT. 
5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦ = 0 aces
   * 4♥ = 1 ace
   * 4♠ = 2 aces
   * 4NT = 3 aces

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦ = 0 or 4 kings
   * 5♥ = 1 king
   * 5♠ = 2 kings
   * 5NT = 3 kings

### 5NT Pick a Slam
A voluntary bid of 5NT is forcing and asks partner to try to pick the best slam available.
There are no hard-and-fast rules here, but possibilities include:
   * bidding a new 4-card suit (looking for a 4-4 fit)
   * supporting partner with mild support (looking for a good 7-card fit)
   * rebidding a previously bid suit with unannounced length and/or strength
   * returning to 6NT with no better options

The asker may continue to bid up the line if completely displeased with the response.

## Defensive Bidding 
### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 8–16 points nonvulnerable and 10-16 points vulnerable
(double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
In general an overcall shows 5+ cards 
but it may show a strong 4 (AKJx) at the one level.

The one exception is over 1♣ where an overcall of 1♦ does little to obstruct the opponents.
(1♣)
   * 1♦ = a good 4 or bad 5, often lead-directing
   * 2♦ = sound overcall (would bid over 1♠)
   
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.

Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural.

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠ = a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣ = a hand that would open 3♣.

When the opponents have bid two suits,
an overcall in either suit is natural.

#### Responses
Raises are natural and generally preemptive.
A new suit by an unpassed hand is forcing. 
By a passed hand, a new suit is non-forcing but constructive.

A cuebid of opener’s suit shows good support (limit raise or better).

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠ = minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other = natural, game-forcing.

### NT Overcalls
With appropriate strength and a stopper in the opponent's suit,
you may make a NT overcall.
All systems are on - effectively the opening bid is ignored.

#### Direct Position (1X-?)
   * 10-14 HCP: pass or double then pass
   * 15-18 HCP: 1NT
   * 19-21 HCP: double then bid NT
   * 22-24 HCP: double then jump NT
   
#### Balancing Position (1X-p-p-?)
   * 10-13 HCP: pass or double
   * 14-17 HCP: 1NT
   * 18-21 HCP: double then bid NT
   * 22-24 HCP: 3NT

#### 2-Level (2X-? or 1X-p-2X-?)
   * 15-18 HCP: 2NT
   * 19-21 HCP: 3NT
   * 22-24 HCP: double then 3NT
      
#### 3-Level (3X-? or any-p-3X-?)
   * 15-18 HCP: pass or 3NT
   * 19-24 HCP: 3NT

### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits. 
(It may show 4-5-2-2 distribution but in that case it should be a king stronger.)

(1♦) - 2NT = hearts and clubs

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.

In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Note: Unusual 2NT may be off in the reopening seat (see NT Overcalls above).
### Michaels Cuebid
A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid only one suit is a Michaels cuebid,
showing a 5–5 two-suiter (or more distributional). 

   * If the opening is in a minor suit, the cuebid shows the majors; 
   * If the opening is in a major, the cuebid shows the
other major and an unspecified minor.

The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.
When vulnerable, it is best to avoid very weak hands. 
(This also makes it easier for advancer to decide to bid game.)
When non-vulnerable, the low-end range is much wider. 

#### Responses to a Minor Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
1. 2NT: Invitational
1. Opponent's suit: Game or slam try

#### Responses to a Major Cuebid

1. Major at lowest level: Preference (usually 3)
2. Jump in major: Weak if below game
1. 2NT: asks for overcaller’s minor.
   * If advancer then returns to the major, this is invitational.
   * If there is further interference, 4NT may also ask for the minor.

#### Rare Responses to Either Cuebid

2. Jump in major: Good support, but weak if below game
1. Unbid minor (no further interference): Weak
1. 3NT: To play

#### Overcaller Rebids
Overcaller will normally have a weak hand and will pass or make a minimum response. 
With a strong hand or freakier distribution, overcaller will make some other bid.
### Meckwell vs. Strong 1NT
Meckwell features multiple ways to show single-suited or 5-4 hands.  
   * double: long minor or both majors or 18+ HCP 
   * 2♣: clubs and a major
   * 2♦: diamonds and a major
   * 2♥: natural, rebiddable
   * 2♠: natural, rebiddable
   * 2NT: minors

After double, Advancer is expected to relay to 2♣. 
Responses to 2♣:
   * pass: single-suited with clubs
   * 2♦: single-suited with diamonds
   * 2♥: both majors
   * 2♠: both majors, but spades are stronger
   * 3♣: natural, rebiddable

After 2♣ or 2♦, Advancer may pass or bid 2♥. 
Overcaller may pass or correct to 2♠.
### Overcalls of Strong Openings
Against any strong opening (usually 2♣ or 1♣), 
an overcall is a transfer to the next higher suit.

## Preemptive Bids
Opening suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and based on playing tricks
(the number of tricks you expect to take if your long suit is trumps).
Overbid based on the rule of 2-3-4:
   * vulnerable vs. nonvulnerable: overbid by 2 tricks
   * equal vulnerability: overbid by 3 tricks
   * nonvulnerable vs. vulnerable: overbid by 4 tricks

Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:
   * more than one outside trick
   * a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better
   * a void in a minor

Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.
## Competitive Bidding 
It is sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠J43 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣J3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

### New Suits
In a competitive sequence, new suits by an unpassed hand are forcing.
(To make a constructive, non-forcing bid, consider a Negative Double.)
New suits by a passed hand are constructive but non-forcing.

Jump shifts are weak, showing a similar hand to a preempt.

### Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows a limit raise or better:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = limit raise or better.

Note: If playing inverted minors ON in competition, then that treatment supercedes this one.

### Jump Raise
When using this treatment, a jump raise is weak / competitive.

1♠ - (2♣) - 3♠ = weak, 4+ card support

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+  

### With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

#### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (12–14 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

### Against Conventions
After partner opens in a suit and a conventional bid by the opponents shows one known suit, 
a cue bid shows a good raise, a double shows a good hand without support, and other bids are weak. 
For example:

1♠ — (2♠:Michaels) 
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: weak
   * 3♥: Limit raise or better in spades.
   * Double: at least 10 points, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

If the conventional bid shows two known suits, 
there are two cue bids available and the second shows the fourth suit. 
For example:

1♣ — (2NT:Unusual) 
   * 3♣, 3♠: weak
   * 3♦: Limit raise or better in clubs.
   * 3♥: 10+HCP, 5+ spades
   * Double: at least 10 points, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

### Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major. 
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level. 
With insufficient points, double may also be used with a five-card suit.

   * 1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.
   * 1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).
   * 1♦ — (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–6 points.
   * 1♠ — (4♦) — Double = four hearts and 10+ points or five hearts and 8-10 points.

If both majors are bid, then a double shows both minors.
   * 1♥ — (1♠) — Double = 4-4 or better in the minors.

When the opponents overcall a minor over a minor at the two-level or higher, 
a double shows at least one four-card major.

   * 1♦ — (2♣) — Double = at least one four-card major.
   * 1♣ — (2♦) — Double = at least one four-card major.

If opener bids the a major you cannot support, 
rebid opener's first suit or NT to imply the other major.

### Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double:

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * 2NT = limit raise (at least 10 points) — or better.
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, but it is better to make a more
descriptive bid of 1♥, 1♠, or 2NT with the appropriate hand.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

A responder’s jump shift after a double is to play:

1♦ — (Double) — 2♥, 2♠, 3♣ = six-plus card suit, like a weak two-bid or
preemptive three-bid.
### Doubles
A double is for takeout over a partscore bid (4♦ or lower) and 
penalty over opening game bids (4♥ or higher). 
However, advancer may pull the double with undisclosed distribution and/or poor defensive values.

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational (9-12 declarer points). 
To force for one round, responder cuebids opener’s suit. 
This is forcing to game by an unpassed hand.

Any subsequent bid by doubler shows significant extras and is strongly invitational to game. 
If advancer has jumped, then a new suit or NT bid by doubler is forcing to game.
### Responsive Doubles
After an opponent bids at the one level, partner doubles for takeout,
and the other opponent and raises, a double by advancer is responsive. 
This allows the original doubler to be declarer and to pick the preferred suit.

Responsive Doubles are on through 4♦ but off after a preempt.
### Card-Showing Doubles
Card-showing doubles are used when there is a general desire to act but no clear direction.
Partner is asked to "do something intelligent" like bid an unbid four-card suit,
rebid a good suit, bid NT, or show secondary support.
Generally they are for takeout but they may be converted to penalty (like a Negative Double).
### Redoubles
A redouble can have one of three meanings:

To play if: 
   * your side is at the four level or higher:
      * 4♠ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty
   * the opponents double a conventional bid:
      * 1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — Redouble = Penalty, good diamond suit;

A good hand if: 
   * their double is for takeout:
      * 1♠ — (Double) — Redouble = 10+ points;

SOS, requesting a different suit if:
   * your side is doubled for penalty in a trump suit
at the three level or lower:
      * 1♦ — (Pass) — Pass — (Double) — Pass — (Pass) — Redouble = SOS, responder can support at least two of the
unbid suits.

## Defensive Leads and Signals 
#### Carding
First discard is attitude for that suit. (See "Signals" below.)
#### Leads
Leads are: 
   * top of touching honors and interior sequences.
   * A from A–K–x
   * 4th best from x-x-x-x or x-x-x-x-x. 
   * Top from x–x–x.

#### Signals (Upside-Down Count and Attitude)
   1. Attitude (low encourages)
   1. Count (low = even)
   1. Suit preference (high = higher suit)

A jack is an encouraging card, more than a 2.

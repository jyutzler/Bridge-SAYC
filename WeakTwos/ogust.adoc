A weak two-bid shows a 6-card suit of reasonable quality 
and roughly 4–10 HCP, but flexible based on vulnerability and position. 
It may be a good 5-card suit (if vulnerable it must be very good). 
It may also be a poor 7-card suit 
(not good enough to open with at the three level)
but in MP scoring three level bids are pretty lenient. 

### Responses

* New suit: forcing
** Raise of responder's suit: honor-doubleton or better
** Retreat: no outside strength
** New suit: strength in that suit 
** 3NT: solid suit (AKJ... or better)
* 2NT: forcing, showing game interest (on in competition) 
** 3♣: bad hand, bad suit
** 3♦: bad hand, good suit 
** 3♥: good hand, bad suit
** 3♠: good hand, good suit 
** 3NT: solid suit (AKJ... or better)
* Any raise: to play, preemptive
* 3NT: to play (typically a good hand with three-card support)

### After Interference

* 2X(any): 
** redouble of double: lead-directing (shows top honor)
** double of overcall: penalty
** 2NT: systems on
** 3X: to play (preemptive), usually with a 3-card suit but honor-doubleton is permissible
** new suit: non-forcing, lead-directing
** 4X: to play (could be strong or preemptive)

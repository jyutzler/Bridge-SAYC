#### Responder's Rebids
Responder promises to bid a second time unless unless opener’s rebid is at the game level, 
since opener could have 18 points (just short of a jump shift rebid). 
(This applies when responder is an unpassed hand.)
If responder bids a second time, it is either in support of opener or an attempt to find a NT contract.
A non-jump raise of opener’s first suit is invitational, usually with three-card support.

1!S — 2!C
2!D — 2!S, 2NT, 3!C, 3!D = invitation to game (10–11 points).
    — 2!H = game force, could be conventional.
    — 3!S = game force with extras.
    — 4!S = game, no extras.

1!H — 2!C
2!S — 2NT, 3!C, 3!S = invitation to game (10–11 points).
    — 3!D = game force, could be conventional. (Bidding 4!H next would show extras.)
    — 4!H = game, no extras.

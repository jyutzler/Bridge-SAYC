#### Responder's Rebids
Responder promises to bid a second time unless unless opener’s rebid is at the game level, 
since opener could have 18 points (just short of a jump shift rebid). 
(This applies when responder is an unpassed hand.)
If responder bids a second time, it is either in support of opener or an attempt to find a NT contract.
A subsequent jump raise of opener’s first suit to the THREE LEVEL is game 
forcing — responder should make a limit raise directly over the opening with 10–11 
points and at least three-card support:

1!S — 2!C
2!D — 2NT, 3!C, 3!D = invitation to game (10–11 points).
    — 2!S = preference, not forcing. Responder has 11–12 points and a doubleton spade.
    — 2!H = game force, could be conventional.
    — 3!S = game force.

1!S — 2!C
2!H — 2NT, 3!C, 3!H = invitation to game (10–11 points).
    — 2!S = preference, not forcing. Responder has 11–12 points and a doubleton spade.
    — 3!D = game force, could be conventional.
    — 3!S = game force.

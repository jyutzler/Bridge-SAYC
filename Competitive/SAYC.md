There is almost an endless variety of possible sequences, so it pays to have simple
guidelines to prevent bidding misunderstandings.

Bids mean the same things they meant without the intervening bid. Still, it is
sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠J43 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣J3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows values for game without clear
direction for the moment. This is often used to show a game-forcing raise:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = game force; usually a raise.

## With Conventions
Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, any bid or double by an opponent cancels a
convention intended for non-competitive sequences.

### Examples
   * 1♥ — 2♠ — 2NT = natural (12–14 HCP).
   * 2♣ — Double — 2♦ = natural and positive.

   
## Against Conventions
If the opponents use a convention (such as Michaels or the unusual notrump), you
can double to show at least 10 points, or you can cuebid one of their shown suits
to force to game.
1♠ — (2♠) 
   * 3♥ = game force.
   * Double = at least 10 points, probably balanced.

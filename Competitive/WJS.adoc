When the opponents interfere, opener sometimes has an awkward rebid. For example:

* 1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)
** Rebid 2♠ with ♠943 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣Q3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed, make a reopening double if the ♣Q is in another suit)

### New Suits
In a competitive sequence, new suits by an unpassed hand are forcing.
(To make a constructive, non-forcing bid, consider a Negative Double.)
New suits by a passed hand are constructive but non-forcing.

Jump shifts are weak, showing a similar hand to a preempt.

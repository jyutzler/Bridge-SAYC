### Doubles
A double is for takeout over a partscore bid (4♦ or lower) and 
penalty over opening game bids (4♥ or higher). 
However, advancer may pull the double with undisclosed distribution and/or poor defensive values.

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational (9-12 declarer points). 
To force for one round, responder cuebids opener’s suit. 
This is forcing to game by an unpassed hand.

Any subsequent bid by doubler shows significant extras and is strongly invitational to game. 
If advancer has jumped, then a new suit or NT bid by doubler is forcing to game.

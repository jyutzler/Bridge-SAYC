### Support Doubles
Unless overruled elsewhere, after opener bids a suit and 
responder bids another suit:

* if RHO overcalls, a double shows 3-card support for responder
* if RHO doubles, a redouble shows 3-card support for responder

Eschewing the support double shows 4-card support.

Support Doubles are on through {support-double-max}. 
At a higher level, doubles in competition are card-showing.

#### Exceptions
* 1♣-(p)-1♦-(X);XX: support, but bidding a major takes priority
* 1♣-(p)-1♦-(1M);X: negative

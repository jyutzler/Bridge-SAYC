### Support Doubles
Unless overruled elsewhere, after opener bids a suit, 
responder bids another suit, and RHO overcalls, 
a double shows three-card support for responder. 
If RHO doubles, a redouble shows 3-card support for responder.
Eschewing the support double shows 4-card support.

Support Doubles are on through 2♥. 
At 2♠ or higher, doubles in competition are card-showing.

#### Exceptions
* 1♣-(p)-1♦-(X);XX: support, but bidding a major takes priority
* 1♣-(p)-1♦-(1M);X: negative

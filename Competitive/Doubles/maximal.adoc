### Maximal Double
Under normal circumstances, a bid of an intervening suit is a game-try. 
In the following cases, no suit game-try is available:

* after heart support, the opponents compete to 3♦
* after spade support, the opponents compete to 3♥

In these cases, the Maximal Double is used to show a game try.

### Support Doubles
Unless overruled elsewhere, after opener bids a suit, 
responder bids another suit, and RHO overcalls, 
a double shows three-card support for responder. 
If RHO doubles, a redouble shows 3-card support for responder.
Eschewing the support double shows 4-card support.

The one exception to this rule is the sequence 1♣-(p)-1♦-(1♠);X - this shows hearts and is not a support double.

Support Doubles are on through 2♠.

NOTE: This is the Washington Standard treatment.

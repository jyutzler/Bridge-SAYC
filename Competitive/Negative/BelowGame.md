## Negative Doubles
The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major. 
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level. 
With insufficient points, double may also be used with a five-card suit.

1♣ — (1♦) — Double = 4–4 or better in the majors.

1♦ — (1♥) — Double = exactly four spades (1♠ promises at least five).

1♦ — (1♠) — Double = four hearts and 6+ points or five hearts and 5–10 points.

1♠ — (4♦) — Double = four hearts and 10+ points or five hearts and 8-10 points.

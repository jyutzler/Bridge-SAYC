### Against Conventions (Unusual over Unusual)
After partner opens in a suit and a conventional bid by the opponents shows one known suit, 
a cue bid shows a good raise, a double shows a good hand without support, and other bids are weak. 
For example:

1♠ — (2♠:Michaels) 

 * 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: weak
 * 3♥: Limit raise or better in spades.
 * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.

If the conventional bid shows two known suits, 
there are two cue bids available, the lower cue bid shows the lower suit and the higher cue bid shows the higher suit. 
For example:

1♠ — (2NT:Unusual) 

 * 3♦, 3♠: weak
 * 3♣: 10+HCP, 5+ hearts
 * 3♦: Limit raise or better in spades
 * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double

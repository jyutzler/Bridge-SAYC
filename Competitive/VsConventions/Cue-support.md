### Against Conventions
If the opponents use a convention (such as Michaels or the unusual notrump), you
can double to show at least 10 points, or you can cuebid their lowest shown suit
to show a good raise.

1♠ — (2♠) 
   * 3♥ = Limit raise or better.
   * Double = at least 10 points, probably balanced.

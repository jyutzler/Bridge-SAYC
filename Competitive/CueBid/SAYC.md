### Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows values for game without clear
direction for the moment. This is often used to show a game-forcing raise:
   * 1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = game force; usually a raise.

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+

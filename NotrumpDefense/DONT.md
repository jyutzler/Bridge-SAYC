### DONT vs. 1NT
DONT features multiple ways to show single-suited or 5-5 hands (4-5 distribution is possible when non-vulnerable).  
   * double: single-suited 
   * 2♣: clubs and a higher suit
   * 2♦: diamonds and a higher suit
   * 2♥: majors
   * 2♠: spades (normal weak 2 or worse in strength; use 2♣ followed by 2♠ to show a better hand)
   * 2NT: Minors (5-5 or better)

Advancer responses:
   * pass or bid of a shown suit: fit, unconstructive
   * next higher suit: relay (pass or correct)
   * pass of double is for penalty and rare
   * new suit: single-suited
   * jump or raise in shown suit: invitational (8-9 points)

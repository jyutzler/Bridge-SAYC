### Landy vs 1NT
#### Unpassed Hand
Landy is a simple defense to 1NT with only one artificial bid:
   * Double: Penalty
   * 2♣: Majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
   * 2NT: Minors
   * Others: Natural

After 2♣, advancer bids the better major or 2♦ to defer to partner.

#### Passed Hand
Since it is impossible to have a penalty double as a passed hand,
double is a relay to 2♣.

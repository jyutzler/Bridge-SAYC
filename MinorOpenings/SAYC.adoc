A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4=4=3=2 shape which should be opened 1♦. 
With 9+ cards in the minors, generally open the longer minor first. 
Opener should take care to ensure that a suitable rebid is available after partner's response.

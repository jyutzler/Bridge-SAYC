Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 

1♣:

   * 2♣: game-forcing raise
   * 2♦: limit raise (criss-cross)
   * 3♣: preemptive raise
   * 4♣, 5♣: extra preemptive

If a 1♦ opening is natural, then the raise structure is the same, but the limit raise is 3♣ (criss-cross).

Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT. 

### Passed Hand
As a passed hand, the structure changes slightly.

1♣:

   * 2♣: simple or mixed raise
   * 2♦: limit raise (criss-cross)
   * 2♥, 2♠: fit jump (5+ clubs, 4+ in side suit, invitational but NF)
   * 3♣: preemptive raise
   * 4♣, 5♣: extra preemptive

### In Competition
In competition, the structure is mostly natural.

1♣(any):

* 1X: see 1 over 1 system
* 2♣: simple raise (includes some mixed raises)
* cue: limit raise or better
* #X (nonjump): natural, forcing for 1 round if below game
* #X (jump): fit jump (5+ clubs, 4+ in side suit, invitational but NF)
* 3♣, 4♣, 5♣: preemptive raise

### Continuations
After a raise, new suits are NT-oriented (stopper-showing).

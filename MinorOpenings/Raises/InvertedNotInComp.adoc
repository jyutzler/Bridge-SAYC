Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.
Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better) 
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive). When vulnerable, a jump raise should be 
sound (8-9 dummy points) but when non-vulnerable it is much more wide-ranging.

1♦

* 2♦: limit raise or better (limit raise as passed hand)
 ** 2♥, 2♠, 3♣: stopper
 ** 2NT: balanced minimum, side suits stopped
 ** 3♦: unbalanced minimum
 ** 3♥, 3♠, 4♣: extras, splinter
 ** 3NT: 18-19, side suits stopped
 ** 4/5♦: to play
* 3♦: preemptive

#### In Competition
Inverted raises are off in all competition.

* 2m: courtesy (3-4 card support)
* 3m: preemptive
* cue: good support (redouble if interference is a double unless another convention described elsewhere is in effect)

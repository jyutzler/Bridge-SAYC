### Raises

Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better) 
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive).
Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣, 
though one fewer trump will do in a pinch in a competitive sequence).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.

1♦ - 2♦

   * 2♥, 2♠ = stopper
   * 2NT = balanced minimum, side suits stopped
   * 3♦ = unbalanced minimum
   * 3NT = 18-19, side suits stopped

Inverted raises are on in competition.

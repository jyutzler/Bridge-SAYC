A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4–4–3–2 shape: 
four spades, four hearts, three diamonds, and two clubs, which should
be opened 1♦. 
However, it is acceptable to open 1♣ when 4-4 in the minors especially with a 
balanced hand (opener expects to bid NT next).

Responses and later bidding generally follow the ideas set down in the previous
section. Bidding at the one level is up-the-line in principle. 

Responses of 2NT and 3NT are standard:

1♣
   * 2NT = 13–16, game forcing
   * 3NT = 17–18

### Raises
Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better) 
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive).
Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣, 
though one fewer trump will do in a pinch in a competitive sequence).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major. 
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.

1♦ - 2♦
   * 2♥, 2♠ = stopper
   * 2NT = balanced minimum, side suits stopped
   * 3♦ = unbalanced minimum
   * 3NT = 18-19, side suits stopped

Inverted raises are on in competition.

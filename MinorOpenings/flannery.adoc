An opening bid of 2♦ shows exactly 4 spades and either 5 or 6 hearts with 10-15HCP. 
Responder is expected to pick a place to play or bid 2NT to inquire, 
but may pass with a poor fit and diamonds.

* pass or any minor: to play
* 2♥, 2♠: to play (preference)
* 2NT: forcing inquiry

** 3♥: 4=5=2=2 minimum
** 3♠: 4=5=2=2 maximum, bad minors
** 3NT: 4=5=2=2 maximum, good minors
** 4m: 4-card minor (4=5=4-0)
** 4♥: 6-card suit
* 3♥, 3♠: invitational
* 3NT, 4♥, 4♠: to play

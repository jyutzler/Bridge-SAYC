#### 1♦
A 1♦ response to 1♣ shows one of the following hand types:

 * Rebiddable diamonds
 * A game force with 4+ diamonds (does not deny a 4-card major)
 * A balanced 6 HCP (responder will pass any subsequent non-forcing bid)

Opener rebids 1NT with a balanced minimum. 
With an unbalanced hand, opener makes the cheapest logical bid.

Responder's second round bid of 2 of a major is game-forcing and natural.

#### 1♥ or 1♠
A major response to a minor opening promises 4+ cards and 6+ dummy points 
and is forcing for one round.

  * With four hearts and four spades or more hearts than spades, bid hearts first.
  * With more spade than hearts or an equal number (5+), bid spades first.

Opener must support a major with four-card support.
Opener may support a major with three-card support,
particularly with a side singleton or weak doubleton.
Without support, opener bids 1NT with a balanced hand 
or a stiff honor in responder's suit.
If this is not possible either, opener must rebid a minor even with only five cards in the opening suit.

#### 1♣-1♦; 1♥-1♠
The sequence is an artificial, one-round force 
showing one of the following hand types (non-exhaustive?):

  * 4 spades, 6 diamonds, non-game-force
  * tolerance for either minor (for example, 3=2=5=3)
  * NT interest, but ambivalence about declaring (i.e., no tenaces)

Opener should respond in this priority:

  * 2♠: 4 spades (4=4=0=5 or 4=4=1=4 distribution)
  * 2♥: extreme distribution like 1=5=0=7
  * 1NT: shortness in diamonds but stoppers elsewhere
  * 2♦: 3+ diamonds
  * 2♣: 6 clubs or a strong 5

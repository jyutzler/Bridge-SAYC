#### 1♦
A 1♦ response to 1♣ shows one of the following hand types:

 * Rebiddable diamonds
 * A game force with 4+ diamonds (does not deny a 4-card major)
 * A balanced 6 HCP (responder will pass any subsequent non-forcing bid)

Opener rebids 1NT with a balanced minimum. 
With an unbalanced hand, opener makes the cheapest logical bid.

#### 1♥ or 1♠
This promises 4+ cards and 6+ dummy points and is forcing for one round.

  * With four hearts and four spades or more hearts than spades, bid hearts first.
  * With more spade than hearts or an equal number (5+), bid spades first.

Opener must support a major with four-card support.
Opener may support a major with three-cards support, 
particularly with a side singleton or weak doubleton.
Without support, opener bids 1NT with a balanced hand 
or a stiff honor in responder's suit.
If this is not possible either, opener must rebid a minor even with only five cards in the opening suit.

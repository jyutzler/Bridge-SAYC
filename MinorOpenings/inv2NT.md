A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened. 
The exception is a hand with 4–4–3–2 shape: 
four spades, four hearts, three diamonds, and two clubs, which should
be opened 1♦.

Responses and later bidding generally follow the ideas set down in the previous
section. Bidding at the one level is up-the-line in principle. Responder needs more
trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣, though one fewer trump will do
in a pinch in a competitive sequence). 

NT responses are as follows:

1♣
   * 1NT = 7-10, usually sign-off
   * 2NT = 11-12, invitational
   * 3NT = 13–15, game forcing

There is no forcing minor-suit raise.

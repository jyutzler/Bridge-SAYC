### Opener 2NT Rebid
In most circumstances, opener's jump to 2NT shows a stronger-than-1NT opening (17 or 18-19 HCP). The following structure applies (similar structure for other combinations).

1m - 1X; 2NT: 

* pass: weak hand, 4-card suit
* 3♣: inquiry
** 3♦: two-card support for major (non-forcing, any non-game response is to play, and any game response is a slam try)
** 3X: three-card support for major (non-forcing, any non-game response is to play, and any game response is a slam try)
* 3♦: game forcing, artificial checkback
** 3X, 3Y: three-card support for major or new four-card major (up the line)
** 3NT: to play
* 3♥, 3♠: Natural (6+ if rebid, 4 cards if new suit), GF
* 3NT/4NT/5NT/6NT: natural, suggesting a 4-card suit (signoff/quantitative/pick-a-slam/signoff)
* 4♣: Gerber
* 4X: 6+ cards, signoff
* 4♥ (after 1♠): 5-5 distribution, signoff

### Reverses
After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows a good 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit.
(HCP strength can be lowered in cases of extreme distribution.)
It is forcing and game-forcing unless Responder bids with the cheapest new strain available as shown in the following table:

|Bid Sequence|Weak Response|
|-----------|---------------|
|1♣-1♥;2♦|2♠|
|1♣-1♠;2♦|2♥|
|1♣-1NT;2♦|2♥|
|1♣-1NT;2♥|2♠|
|1♣-1♠;2♥|2NT|
|1♦-1♠;2♥|2NT|
|1♦-1NT;2♥|2♠|
|1♥-1NT;2♠|2NT|

If the weak response is made, opener will retreat to 3♣ unless the distribution is particularly freaky.

All other bids by Responder are natural and forcing to game.
A rebid of the first suit shows a decent 5+ cards.

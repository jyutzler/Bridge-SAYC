A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points, or the playing equivalent. 

Responses:

2♣ 
   * 2♦= conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response.
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦= natural and game forcing. At least a five-card suit and
8 points.
   * 2NT = a balanced 8 HCP.

After a 2♦ response, opener bids a suit naturally:
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦ = natural, forcing
   * 2NT = 22-24 points (see responses for 2NT opening above)
   * 3NT = 28+ points (see responses for 3NT opening above)

In response to a suit rebid, responder indicates strength.

2♣ — 2♦

2♥ 
   * 2♠, 3♦ = natural, game force
   * 3♣ = artificial, very weak (0-4, not an ace)
   * 3NT = no support, 5-7 points
   * 3♥ = positive, slam invitational
   * 4♥ = sign-off

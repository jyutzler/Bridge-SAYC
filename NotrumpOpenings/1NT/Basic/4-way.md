### Basic Responses
   * 2♣ = Stayman (also for invitational hands)
   * 2NT = Transfer to 3♣, bust or slam invitation
   * 3♣ = Transfer to 3♦, bust or slam invitation
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+. However, transfers (if available) are preferred.
   * 3NT = sign-off
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

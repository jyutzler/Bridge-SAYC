#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major. 
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 2♥ = transfer to spades. 

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level 
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, 
that is natural and game forcing. 
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠
   * Pass = content to play 2♠.
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3♠
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥ = natural and game forcing (4+).
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠.
   * 4NT = quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit.
   * 5NT = asking for a choice between 6♠ and 6NT.

#### Single-suited Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major. 
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):
   * 4♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 4♥ = transfer to spades 

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer, 
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands 
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents. 
   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Game invitation (would make a 1/1 bid): Jacoby, raise (Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.)
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Jacoby, raise to 4
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Texas, 4NT (Blackwood)

#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major. 
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 2♥ = transfer to spades

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level 
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, 
that is natural and game forcing. 
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠
   * Pass = content to play 2♠
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit
      * Pass or 3♠: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * 3♣, 3♦ = natural and game forcing (4+)
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠
   * 4NT = quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit

#### Single-suited Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major. 
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):

   * 4♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 4♥ = transfer to spades 

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer, 
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands 
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents. 
The following shows how they are used with strong NT (15-17) openings.

   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * 3♠ = invitational with a six-card suit (would make a 1 over 1 bid)
      * pass: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Jacoby, raise to 4 in suit
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Texas, 4NT (Blackwood)
   * Grand Slam Force (asking to bid 7 with 2 of top 3 honors): Texas, 5NT

It is rare, but a direct bid of 4♠ or 6♠ is to play and is only used when your hand is not amenable to transferring.

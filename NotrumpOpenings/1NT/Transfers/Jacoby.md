### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major. 
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦ = transfer to hearts
   * 2♥ = transfer to spades. 

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level 
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, 
that is natural and game forcing. 
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠
   * Pass = content to play 2♠.
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3♠
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥ = natural and game forcing (4+).
   * 3♠ = invitational with a six-card suit. Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠.
   * 4NT = quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit.

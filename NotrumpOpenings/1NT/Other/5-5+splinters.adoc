 * 3♣: 5-5 minors, GF
 * 3♦: 5-5 minors, Inv
 * 3♥, 3♠: shortness in the shown suit, 3 in the other major, 5-4 or better in the minors
 * 4♣: Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
 * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).

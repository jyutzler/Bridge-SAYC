#### Smolen 5-4 or better in the Majors
If responder is weak, transfer to the five-card major and pass.
Otherwise use a Stayman to show 5-4 in the majors as follows:

1NT — 2♣; 2♦
   * pass: weak, generally four diamonds
   * 2♥ or 2♠: that major, invitational
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Over 2NT, a similar system applies but there are no invitational bids:

1NT — 3♣; 3♦
   * pass: weak, four diamonds
   * transfer to five-card major, pass: weak, less than four diamonds
   * 3♥ or 3♠: the other major, game-forcing
   * 4♦ or 4♥: transfer to 4♥ or 4♠, at least 6, slam interest (Otherwise bypass Smolen and use a straight transfer)

Smolen does not apply over 3NT.

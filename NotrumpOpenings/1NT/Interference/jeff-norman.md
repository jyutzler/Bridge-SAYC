#### Over Interference
All systems are on over double. 

1NT — (double) — Redouble = Rescue - weak with a long minor (opener bids 2♣, pass or correct).

1NT — (2♣) — Double = Stayman without game-forcing values. 

If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥ = Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts

3-level bids have a different meaning if the opponents show a suit.

   * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, denying a stopper
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+.
   * Cue bid of opponent's suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

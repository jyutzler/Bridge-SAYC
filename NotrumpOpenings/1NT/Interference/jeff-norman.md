Systems are on over double and 2♣. 
A double of 2♣ is Stayman without game-forcing values. 

3-level bids have a different meaning if the opponents show a suit.

   * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, denying a stopper
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+.
   * Cue bid of opponent's suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is "non-forcing" Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit (Garbage Stayman).
Garbage Stayman is suitable for weak hands with the following shape:

* 4=4=4=1
* (3-4)=5=1
* 3=3=5=2 (maybe)
* (3-4)=4=2 (maybe)

Usually responder will have a decent 8+ HCPs (assuming a 15-17 1NT range).

Opener rebids:

 * 2♦: no four-card major
 * 2♥: four or five hearts and less than five spades
 * 2♠: five spades (possibly with four hearts) or four spades

Responder's rebids after 2♥ or 2♠:

 * 2♠ (over 2♥): four spades, denies four hearts
 * 3♠ (over 2♥) or 3♥ (over 2♠): forcing raise, slam interest, requests cue bid
 * 3 of that major: invitational
 * 4 of that major: to play

Responder's rebids after any response:

 * 2NT: invitational, not necessarily with an unbid major
 * 3♣, 3♦: 5+ cards, denies opener's shown major (if any), GF, slam interest; opener responses:
 ** 3♥ after 1NT-2♣;2♠-3m: good support for hearts, 5=4=2=2 pattern
 ** 3♠ after 1NT-2♣;2♥-3m: good support for spades (responder's implied major)
 ** 4 other major (see hand patterns from previous two lines) or 5m: to play
 ** new previously denied suit: cue bid in support of minor
 * 3NT: to play (over 2♥ it promises 4♠ – choice of games)
 * 4♣, 4♦, 4♥ (over 2♠): splinter
 * 4NT: quantitative

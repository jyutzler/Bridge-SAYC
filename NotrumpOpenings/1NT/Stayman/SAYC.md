#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit.

Opener rebids:

   * 2♦ with no four-card major 
   * 2♥ with four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠ with four spades or five spades and four hearts

Responder will generally invite or bid game. 
If responder rebids three of either minor,
he shows slam interest and at least a five-card suit.
A rebid of 4NT over a major is Blackwood so if you want to make a quantitative raise, 
you must bid a minor first.

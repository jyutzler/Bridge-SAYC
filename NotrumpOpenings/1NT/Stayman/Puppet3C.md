#### 3♣ Puppet Stayman
3♣ is a game-forcing artificial bid that is designed to find both 5-3 and 4-4 fits.
It is on over 1NT and 2NT openings.

Opener rebids:
   * 3♦: no five-card major and at least one four-card major
   * 3♥ or 3♠: five of that major
   * 3NT: no four-card or five-card major

After 3♦:
   * 3♥ or 3♠: four of the other major
   * 3NT: signoff
   * 4♦: 4 of both majors
   * 4 of that major: signoff - usually six cards and three of the other major

After 3 of a major:
   * 4 of that major: signoff
   * The other major: Good hand, requests cue bids

After any response:
   * 3NT: signoff
   * 4♣: Gerber (key card if over a major)

#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor.

   * 2♠ = transfer to clubs
   * 3♣ = transfer to diamonds

Opener accepts the transfer unless game is reachable opposite nothing more than Qxxxxx.

A 2NT response to 2♠ is a preacceptance which shows good support for clubs.

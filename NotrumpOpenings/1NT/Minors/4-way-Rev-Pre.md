#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor.
Super-accept (if willing to play 3NT opposite KQxxxx and out) by bidding what you like.

   * 2♠ = transfer to clubs
      * 2NT: normal response
      * 3♣: preacceptance (good support)
   * 2NT = transfer to diamonds
      * 3♣: normal response (note: this is non-forcing, giving responder a way out of the auction with a 5-5 weak hand)
      * 3♦: preacceptance (good support)

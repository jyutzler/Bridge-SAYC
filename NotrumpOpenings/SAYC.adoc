Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is particularly strong. 
Semi-balanced hands with either 5-4-2-2 or 6-3-2-2 distribution 
may be treated as balanced if the doubletons are Qx or better. 

A hand may be upgraded 1 point for a long suit with good texture (e.g., QJT9x)
and downgraded 1 point for a 4-3-3-3 hand with poor texture (e.g., AJx-KJx-Axx-Qxxx).

The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:

 * 12-14 (weak NT): Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT
 * 15-17 (strong NT): Open 1NT
 * 18-19 (1.5 NT): Open 1 of a suit, jump NT
 * 20-21: Open 2NT
 * 22-24: Open 2♣, rebid NT
 * 25-27, 4-3-3-3: Open 3NT 
 * 24+: Open 2♣, jump NT unless response promises a game force

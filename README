This branch contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes the system that Steve Reed and Jeff Yutzler will use for the LM/NLM game. 
Major openings are loosely based on Washington Standard - 2 over 1 game force (no exceptions) with a reasonable set of conventions.
1 Club openings are transfers and other artificial bids. 
1 Diamond openings are fairly standard, but 1♦-2♣ is not a game force if clubs are rebid.
Note that we generally don't promise specific point counts or minimum shapes.

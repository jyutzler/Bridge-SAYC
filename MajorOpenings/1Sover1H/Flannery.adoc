### 1♠ Over 1♥
Since a bid is available to show a 4=5-x-x hand,
a bid of 1♠ over 1♥ shows a five-card suit.

#### Rebids by Opener
- 1NT: weak NT, 2 spades (non-forcing)
- 2m: 4+ cards, no spade fit
- 2♥: natural (less than invitational), no spade fit
- 2♠: 3+♠, no extras
- 2NT: 1.5NT, 2=5=3=3 (non-forcing)
- 3m: natural jump shift
- 3♥: natural (invitational), no spade fit
- 3♠: balanced (15-17), 3-4♠, excellent heart suit (or would have opened 1NT)
- 4m: 4+♠, splinter, extras (too much for the normal 4=5 bid)
- 4♠: 1.5NT, 3=5-3-2 or 4=5=2=2

#### After any Non-Supporting Rebid by Opener
   - pass: minimum, 5 spades
   - 2♥: false preference
   - 2♠: minimum, 6+ spades
   - 2NT: natural (11-12)
   - raise: invitational
   - new suit: opening strength, natural

#### After 1NT Rebid
   - 2♣ or 2♦: As per 1X-1Y;1Z system (see under <<Minor Openings>>)
   - 2♥: preference (rare, 2 hearts and concern about NT)

#### After 2♣ or 2♦ Rebid
   - raise minor: Invitational
   - other minor: Fourth Suit (see under <<Minor Openings>>)
   - 2♥: preference (2 hearts and no more than 3 of the minor)

### Two Way Reverse Drury
In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall). 
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following: 
   * 2 of a minor shows a limit raise
      * 2♣ = 3 card support
      * 2♦ = 4+ card support
   * Opener clarifies strength with the rebid   
      * Rebidding the suit at the 2 level shows a light opener
      * any other bid shows a full opener

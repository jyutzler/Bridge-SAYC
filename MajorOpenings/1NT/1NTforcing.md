### 1NT Forcing
1NT typically shows 6–12 points and is used in a number of circumstances:
   * No support for the major opened 
   * A three-card limit raise
   * A bust hand with otherwise good trump support (too weak for a direct raise)

It also denies denies four spades after a 1♥ opening.

It is 100% forcing so responder must be prepared for a three-card response or a rebid with only five cards.

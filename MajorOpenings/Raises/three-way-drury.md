#### Three-Way Reverse Drury
In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall). 
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following: 
   * 2♣: 4 cards, mixed raise or better
      * 2♦: asking bid (sign-off at 2 with mixed raise or bid a new suit to show a limit raise and values in that suit)
      * 2♦ over 2♣ OR 2♥ over 2♦: full opener, game try
	  * 2♥ over 1♠-2♣: 4 hearts, game try or better
	  * 2♠ over 1♥-2♣: 4 spades, game try or better
   * 2♦: 3 card limit raise
      * 2 of the major: sign-off
      * 2♥ over 1♠-2♦ OR 2♠ over 1♥-2♦: full opener, game try
	  * 3 of the major: good hand, requests cue bid
	  * 4 of the major: sign-off
   * 2♥ (over 1♠): Standard American 2♥ (about 10HCP, 5 hearts)
   * new suit over the major: Fit jump (4 of opener's major AND a good 4 card major or 5 card minor - the jump suit)
   * 3 of the major: 5+ card support, unbalanced (rare)

#### Basic Responses Over 1♥
   * 1♠ = at least four spades, 6 or more points. Tends to deny a heart fit.
   * 2♣, 2♦ = 11 points or more, promises at least four of the suit or three-card heart support.
   * 2♥ = three-card or longer heart support; 6–10 dummy points.
   * 2♠, 3♣, 3♦ = strong jump shifts. Invites a slam.
   * 3♥ = limit raise (10–12 dummy points with four or more hearts).
   * 4♥ = usually five+ hearts, a singleton or void, and fewer than 10 HCP.

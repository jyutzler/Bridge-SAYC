#### Jacoby 2NT
As an unpassed hand, a 2NT bid over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening is a game-forcing raise (13+ dummy points, 4+ trumps, generally balanced and/or extras) that asks opener to describe his hand to help responder evaluate slam prospects. For example, over 1♥:

* 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: singleton or void in that suit.
* 4♥: minimum balanced hand.
* 3NT: medium hand (16-18 total points).
* 3♥: maximum hand (19+ total points).
* 4♣, 4♦, 4♠: 5-card suit with two of the top three honors.

This treatment is also on after a takeout double but is off as a passed hand (see below).

#### 3NT
3NT: 13-15 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

#### 2NT (passed hand only)
2NT: 11-12 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

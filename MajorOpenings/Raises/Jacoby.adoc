#### Jacoby 2NT
As an unpassed hand, a 2NT bid over a 1♥ or 1♠ opening is a game-forcing raise (13+ dummy points, 4+ trumps, generally balanced and/or extras) that asks opener to describe his hand to help responder evaluate slam prospects. For example, over 1♥:

* 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: singleton or void in that suit.
* 4♥: minimum hand.
* 3NT: medium hand (15–17).
* 3♥: maximum hand (18+).
* 4♣, 4♦, 4♠: 5-card suit with two of the top three honors.
	  
This treatment is off in competition and as a passed hand.
Unless otherwise stated, 2NT is natural.

2NT: 11-12 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.
	  
#### 3NT
3NT: 13-15 HCP, balanced hand with two-card support for partner.

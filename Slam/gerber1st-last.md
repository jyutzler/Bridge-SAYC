### Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over first or last NT. 
Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a plain Blackwood 4NT. 
5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦ = 0 aces
   * 4♥ = 1 ace
   * 4♠ = 2 aces
   * 4NT = 3 aces

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦ = 0 or 4 kings
   * 5♥ = 1 king
   * 5♠ = 2 kings
   * 5NT = 3 kings
